Text Summarization,English,"You are an expert medical assistant named Aloe, developed by the High Performance Artificial Intelligence Group at Barcelona Supercomputing Center(BSC). You are to be a helpful, respectful, and honest assistant.","You will be given a background statement and some study titles and abstracts. Your task is to summarize the main conclusions of the studies. Background: despite significant progress in drug treatment , the prognosis of patients with advanced pulmonary arterial hypertension ( pah ) remains extremely poor . Many pre clinical studies have reported the efficacy of stem cell ( sc ) therapy for pah ; however , this approach remains controversial . The aim of this systematic review and meta- analysis is to assess the potential efficacy of sc therapy for pah . Study1: safety and efficacy of autologous endothelial progenitor cells transplantation in children with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension: open-label pilot study. Experimental data suggest that transplantation of epcs attenuates monocrotaline-induced pulmonary hypertension in rats and dogs . In addition , our previous studies suggested that autologous epc transplantation was feasible , safe , and might have beneficial effects on exercise capacity and pulmonary hemodynamics in adults with ipah . Thus , we hypothesized that transplantation of epcs would improve exercise capacity and pulmonary hemodynamics in children with ipah . Thirteen children with ipah received intravenous infusion of autologous epcs . The right-sided heart catheterization and 6-mwd test were performed at baseline and at the time of 12 wk after cell infusion . At the time of 12 wk , mpap decreased by 6.4 mmhg from 70.3 + /- 19.0 to 63.9 + /- 19.3 mmhg ( p = 0.015 ) . Pvr decreased by approximately 19 % from 1118 + /- 537 to 906 + /- 377 dyn s/cm(5 ) ( p = 0.047 ) . Co increased from 3.39 + /- 0.79 to 3.85 + /- 0.42 l/min ( p = 0.048 ) . The 6-mwd increased by 39 m from 359 + /- 82 to 399 + /- 74 m ( p = 0.012 ) . Nyha functional class also improved . There were no severe adverse events with cell infusion . The small pilot study suggested that intravenous infusion of autologous epcs was feasible , safe , and associated with significant improvements in exercise capacity , nyha functional class , and pulmonary hemodynamics in children with ipah . Confirmation of these results in a r and omized controlled trial are essential study2: inhaled iloprost for severe pulmonary hypertension. Background uncontrolled studies suggested that aerosolized iloprost , a stable analogue of prostacyclin , causes selective pulmonary vasodilatation and improves hemodynamics and exercise capacity in patients with pulmonary hypertension . Methods we compared repeated daily inhalations of 2.5 or 5.0 microg of iloprost ( six or nine times per day ; median inhaled dose , 30 microg per day ) with inhalation of placebo . A total of 203 patients with selected forms of severe pulmonary arterial hypertension and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension ( new york heart association [ nyha ] functional class iii or iv ) were included . The primary end point was met if , after week 12 , the nyha class and distance walked in six minutes were improved by at least one class and at least 10 percent , respectively , in the absence of clinical deterioration according to predefined criteria and death . Results the combined clinical end point was met by 16.8 percent of the patients receiving iloprost , as compared with 4.9 percent of the patients receiving placebo ( p=0.007 ) . There were increases in the distance walked in six minutes of 36.4 m in the iloprost group as a whole ( p=0.004 ) and of 58.8 m in the subgroup of patients with primary pulmonary hypertension . Overall , 4.0 percent of patients in the iloprost group ( including one who died ) and 13.7 percent of those in the placebo group ( including four who died ) did not complete the study ( p=0.024 ) ; the most common reason for withdrawal was clinical deterioration . As compared with base-line values , hemodynamic values were significantly improved at 12 weeks when measured after iloprost inhalation ( p<0.001 ) , were largely unchanged when measured before iloprost inhalation , and were significantly worse in the placebo group . Further significant beneficial effects of iloprost treatment included an improvement in the nyha class ( p=0.03 ) , dyspnea ( p=0.015 ) , and quality of life ( p=0.026 ) . Syncope occurred with similar frequency in the two groups but was more frequently rated as serious in the iloprost group , although this adverse effect was not associated with clinical deterioration . Conclusions inhaled iloprost is an effective therapy for patients with severe pulmonary hypertension study3: sildenafil reduces pulmonary vascular resistance in single ventricular physiology. Background high pulmonary vascular resistance ( pvr ) may be a risk factor for early and late mortality in both glen shunt and fontan operation patients . Furthermore , pvr may increase long after the fontan operation . Whether pulmonary vasodilators such as phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors can decrease pvr in patients with single ventricular physiology remains undetermined . Methods and results this was a prospect i ve , multicenter study . Patients with single ventricular physiology who have a pvr index higher than 2.5 wood units · ㎡ ( wu ) were enrolled . Cardiac catheterization was performed before and after administration of sildenafil in all patients . After the fontan operation , a six minute walk test ( 6mwt ) was also performed . A total of 42 patients were enrolled . Pvr was significantly decreased in each stage of single ventricular physiology after sildenafil administration : from 4.3±1.5wu to 2.1±0.6wu ( p<0.01 ) in patients before a glenn shunt , from 3.2±0.5wu to 1.6±0.6wu ( p<0.001 ) in patients after a glenn shunt , and from 3.9±1.7wu to 2.3±0.8wu ( p<0.001 ) in patients after fontan . In patients after fontan , the 6mwt increased from 416±74 m to 485±72 m ( p<0.01 ) , and nyha functional class improved significantly ( p<0.05 ) after sildenafil administration . No major side effects were observed in any patients . Conclusions sildenafil reduced pvr in patients with single ventricle physiology . Sildenafil increased exercise capacity and improved nyha functional class in patients after a fontan operation . This implies that pulmonary vasodilation is a potential therapeutic target in selected patients with elevated pvr with single ventricle physiology . Long-term clinical significance warrants further study study4: mesenchymal stem cell prevention of vascular remodeling in high flow-induced pulmonary hypertension through a paracrine mechanism. Unlabelled pulmonary arterial hypertension ( pah ) is characterized by functional and structural changes in the pulmonary vasculature , and despite the drug treatment that made significant progress , the prognosis of patients with advanced ph remains extremely poor . In the present study , we investigated the early effect of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells ( bmscs ) on experimental high blood flow-induced pah model rats and discussed the mechanism . Bmscs were isolated , cultured from bone marrow of sprague-dawley ( sd ) rat . The animal model of pah was created by surgical methods to produce a left-to-right shunt . Following the successful establishment of the pah model , rats were r and omly assigned to three groups ( n=20 in each group ) : sham group ( control ) , pah group , and bmsc group ( received a sublingual vein injection of 1 - 5 × 10(6 ) bmscs ) . Two weeks after the administration , bmscs significantly reduced the vascular remodeling , improved the hemodynamic data , and deceased the right ventricle weight ratio to left ventricular plus septal weight ( rv/lv+s ) ( p<0.05 ) . Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction ( rt-pcr ) and immunohistochemistry analysis results indicated that the inflammation factors such as interleukin-1β ( il-1β ) , il-6 , and tumor necrosis factor-α ( tnf-α ) were reduced ( p<0.05 ) ; the expression of matrix metallo proteinase-9 ( mmp-9 ) was lower ( p<0.05 ) ; vascular endothelial growth factor ( vegf ) was higher in bmsc group than those in pah group ( p<0.05 ) . Conclusion sublingual vein injection of bmscs for 2 weeks , significantly improved the lung and heart injury caused by left-to-right shunt-induced pah ; decreased pulmonary vascular remodeling and inflammation ; and enhanced angiogenesis study5: survival in patients with primary pulmonary hypertension. Results from a national prospective registry. Objective to characterize mortality in persons diagnosed with primary pulmonary hypertension and to investigate factors associated with survival . Design registry with prospect i ve follow-up . Setting thirty-two clinical centers in the united states participating in the patient registry for the characterization of primary pulmonary hypertension supported by the national heart , lung , and blood institute . Patients patients ( 194 ) diagnosed at clinical centers between 1 july 1981 and 31 december 1985 and followed through 8 august 1988 . Measurements at diagnosis , measurements of hemodynamic variables , pulmonary function , and gas exchange variables were taken in addition to information on demographic variables , medical history , and life-style . Patients were followed for survival at 6-month intervals . Main results the estimated median survival of these patients was 2.8 years ( 95 % cl , 1.9 to 3.7 years ) . Estimated single-year survival rates were as follows : at 1 year , 68 % ( cl , 61 % to 75 % ) ; at 3 years , 48 % ( cl , 41 % to 55 % ) ; and at 5 years , 34 % ( cl , 24 % to 44 % ) . Variables associated with poor survival included a new york heart association ( nyha ) functional class of iii or iv , presence of raynaud phenomenon , elevated mean right atrial pressure , elevated mean pulmonary artery pressure , decreased cardiac index , and decreased diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide ( dlco ) . Drug therapy at entry or discharge was not associated with survival duration . Conclusions mortality was most closely associated with right ventricular hemodynamic function and can be characterized by means of an equation using three variables : mean pulmonary artery pressure , mean right atrial pressure , and cardiac index . Such an equation , once vali date d prospect ively , could be used as an adjunct in planning treatment strategies and allocating medical re sources study6: long-term research of stem cells in monocrotaline-induced pulmonary arterial hypertension our previous studies have shown that bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells ( bmscs ) can inhibit the progression of pulmonary artery hypertension ( pah ) in the monocrotaline ( mct ) model in the short term . The aim of this study was to further investigate the long-term effect of bmscs on pah and to explore the mechanism of the protective effect including the pulmonary vascular remodeling and cell differentiation . Pah model was established by subcutaneous injection of 50 mg/kg mct as previously study . Postoperatively , the animals were r and omly divided into three groups ( n = 10 in each group ) : control , pah group , and bmscs implantation group . Six months after injection , immunology and immunohistochemistry analysis indicated the mct-induced intima-media thickness in muscular arteries was reduced ( p < 0.05 ) ; the area of collagen fibers in lung tissue was lower ( p < 0.05 ) , and the proliferating cell nuclear antigen level in pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells was decreased ( p < 0.05 ) . Immunofluorescence showed that the cells have the ability to differentiate between von willebr and factor and vascular endothelial growth factor . Six months after intravenous injection , bmscs could significantly improve pulmonary function by inhibiting the ventricular remodeling and the effect of cell differentiation study7: effects of the dual endothelin-receptor antagonist bosentan in patients with pulmonary hypertension: a randomised placebocontrolled study background endothelin 1 , a powerful endogenous vasoconstrictor and mitogen , might be a cause of pulmonary hypertension . We describe the efficacy and safety of bosentan , a dual endothelin-receptor antagonist that can be taken orally , in patients with severe pulmonary hypertension . Methods in this double-blind , placebo-controlled study , 32 patients with pulmonary hypertension ( primary or associated with scleroderma ) were r and omly assigned to bosentan ( 62.5 mg taken twice daily for 4 weeks then 125 mg twice daily ) or placebo for a minimum of 12 weeks . The primary endpoint was change in exercise capacity . Secondary endpoints included changes in cardiopulmonary haemodynamics , borg dyspnoea index , who functional class , and withdrawal due to clinical worsening . Analysis was by intention to treat . Findings in patients given bosentan , the distance walked in 6 min improved by 70 m at 12 weeks compared with baseline , whereas it worsened by 6 m in those on placebo ( difference 76 m [ 95 % ci 12 - 139 ] , p=0.021 ) . The improvement was maintained for at least 20 weeks . The cardiac index was 1.0 l min(-1 ) m(-2 ) ( 95 % ci 0.6 - 1.4 , p<0.0001 ) greater in patients given bosentan than in those given placebo . Pulmonary vascular resistance decreased by 223 dyn s cm(-)(5 ) with bosentan , but increased by 191 dyn s cm(-5 ) with placebo ( difference -415 [ -608 to -221 ] , p=0.0002 ) . Patients given bosentan had a reduced borg dyspnoea index and an improved who functional class . All three withdrawals from clinical worsening were in the placebo group ( p=0.033 ) . The number and nature of adverse events did not differ between the two groups . Interpretation bosentan increases exercise capacity and improves haemodynamics in patients with pulmonary hypertension , suggesting that endothelin has an important role in pulmonary hypertension study8: syrcle's risk of bias tool for animal studies background systematic review s ( srs ) of experimental animal studies are not yet common practice , but awareness of the merits of conducting such srs is steadily increasing . As animal intervention studies differ from r and omized clinical trials ( rct ) in many aspects , the methodology for srs of clinical trials needs to be adapted and optimized for animal intervention studies . The cochrane collaboration developed a risk of bias ( rob ) tool to establish consistency and avoid discrepancies in assessing the method ological quality of rcts . A similar initiative is warranted in the field of animal experimentation . Methods we provide an rob tool for animal intervention studies ( syrcle 's rob tool ) . This tool is based on the cochrane rob tool and has been adjusted for aspects of bias that play a specific role in animal intervention studies . To enhance transparency and applicability , we formulated signalling questions to facilitate judgment . Results the result ing rob tool for animal studies contains 10 entries . These entries are related to selection bias , performance bias , detection bias , attrition bias , reporting bias and other biases . Half these items are in agreement with the items in the cochrane rob tool . Most of the variations between the two tools are due to differences in design between rcts and animal studies . Shortcomings in , or unfamiliarity with , specific aspects of experimental design of animal studies compared to clinical studies also play a role . Conclusions syrcle 's rob tool is an adapted version of the cochrane rob tool . Widespread adoption and implementation of this tool will facilitate and improve critical appraisal of evidence from animal studies . This may subsequently enhance the efficiency of translating animal research into clinical practice and increase awareness of the necessity of improving the method ological quality of animal studies study9: ambrisentan therapy for pulmonary arterial hypertension. Objectives the purpose of this study was to examine the efficacy and safety of four doses of ambrisentan , an oral endothelin type a receptor-selective antagonist , in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension ( pah ) . Background pulmonary arterial hypertension is a life-threatening and progressive disease with limited treatment options . Endothelin is a vasoconstrictor and smooth muscle cell mitogen that plays a critical role in the pathogenesis and progression of pah . Methods in this double-blind , dose-ranging study , 64 patients with idiopathic pah or pah associated with collagen vascular disease , anorexigen use , or human immunodeficiency virus infection were r and omized to receive 1 , 2.5 , 5 , or 10 mg of ambrisentan once daily for 12 weeks followed by 12 weeks of open-label ambrisentan . The primary end point was an improvement from baseline in 6-min walk distance ( 6mwd ) ; secondary end points included borg dyspnea index , world health organization ( who ) functional class , a subject global assessment , and cardiopulmonary hemodynamics . Results at 12 weeks , ambrisentan increased 6mwd ( + 36.1 m , p < 0.0001 ) with similar and statistically significant increases for each dose group ( range , + 33.9 to + 38.1 m ) . Improvements were also observed in borg dyspnea index , who functional class , subject global assessment , mean pulmonary arterial pressure ( -5.2 mm hg , p < 0.0001 ) , and cardiac index ( + 0.33 l/min/m2 , p < 0.0008 ) . Adverse events were mild and unrelated to dose , including the incidence of elevated serum aminotransferase concentrations > 3 times the upper limit of normal ( 3.1 % ) . Conclusions ambrisentan appears to improve exercise capacity , symptoms , and hemodynamics in patients with pah . The incidence and severity of liver enzyme abnormalities appear to be low",Conclusions: sc therapy is effective for pah in pre clinical studies . These results may help to st and ardise pre clinical animal studies and provide a theoretical basis for clinical trial design in the future .

You are to be a helpful, respectful, and honest assistant.","You will be given a background statement and some study titles and abstracts. Your task is to summarize the main conclusions of the studies. Background: background pulmonary arterial hypertension is a devastating disease , which leads to right heart failure and premature death . Recent evidence suggests that endothelin receptor antagonists may be promising drugs in the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension . Objectives to evaluate the efficacy of endothelin receptor antagonists in pulmonary arterial hypertension . Study1: improvement in exercise capacity with nitric oxide inhalation in patients with precapillary pulmonary hypertension. Background patients with precapillary pulmonary hypertension ( ph ) exhibit a poor exercise capacity due to an impaired vasodilatory response of their pulmonary arteries . By causing the pulmonary artery to dilate , inhaled nitric oxide ( no ) may allow an increase in exercise capacity in patients with ph . Methods and results on 2 separate days , 3 days apart , 14 patients with precapillary ph ( 10 primary ph , 4 residual ph after correction of an intracardiac shunt ; age , 40+/-12 years ; mean pulmonary artery pressure , 60+/-23 mm hg ) performed exercise , with and without inhalation of 20 ppm no , on a cycle ergometer . The work rate was increased 15 w/min until their symptom-limited maximum , with breath-by-breath gas analysis . Patients were r and omly and blindly selected to inhale no on either their first or second test . Peak exercise load and anaerobic threshold tended to increase , but not significantly . Peak oxygen consumption ( f1.Gif "" border=""0"" > o(2 ) ) and deltaf1.Gif "" border=""0"" > o(2)/deltaw ratio increased significantly , by 18 % and 22 % , respectively ( peak f1.Gif "" border=""0"" > o(2 ) , 13.6+/-3.6 to 16.0+/-4 . 1 ml.

Conclusions inhaled no substantially increases oxygen consumption at the same workload during exercise . This finding supports the possibility of ambulatory no inhalation therapy in patients with precapillary ph study2: results of european post-marketing surveillance of bosentan in pulmonary hypertension after the approval of bosentan for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension ( pah ) , european authorities required the introduction of a post-marketing surveillance system ( pms ) to obtain further data on its safety profile . A novel , prospect i ve , internet-based pms was design ed , which solicited reports on elevated aminotransferases , medical reasons for bosentan discontinuation and other serious adverse events requiring hospitalisation . Data captured included demographics , pah aetiology , baseline functional status and concomitant pah-specific medications . Safety signals captured included death , hospitalisation , serious adverse events , unexpected adverse events and elevated aminotransferases . Within 30 months , 4,994 patients were included , representing 79 % of patients receiving bosentan in europe . In total , 4,623 patients were naïve to treatment ; of these , 352 had elevated aminotransferases , corresponding to a crude incidence of 7.6 % and an annual rate of 10.1 % . Bosentan was discontinued due to elevated aminotransferases in 150 ( 3.2 % ) bosentan-naïve patients . Safety results were consistent across subgroups and aetiologies . The novel post-marketing surveillance captured targeted safety data ( "" potential safety signals "" ) from the majority of patients and confirmed that the incidence and severity of elevated aminotransferase levels in clinical practice was similar to that reported in clinical trials . These data complement those from r and omised controlled clinical trials and provide important additional information on the safety profile of bosentan study3: continuous intravenous epoprostenol for pulmonary hypertension due to the scleroderma spectrum of disease pulmonary hypertension is characterized by progressive elevation of pulmonary artery pressure and vascular resistance , often leading to right ventricular failure and death ( 1 - 3 ) . Continuous intravenous infusion of epoprostenol improves prognosis and symptoms in patients with primary ( idiopathic ) pulmonary hypertension ( 4 - 8 ) . R and omized , controlled clinical trials of epoprostenol for secondary pulmonary hypertension have not been conducted . Pulmonary hypertension frequently complicates the scleroderma spectrum of disease , which includes diffuse scleroderma , limited scleroderma ( the crest syndrome [ calcinosis cutis , the raynaud phenomenon , esophageal dysfunction , sclerodactyly , and telangectasia ] ) , and the overlap syndrome . These multisystem diseases are characterized by connective tissue and vascular abnormalities ; vascular lesions are prominent in all affected tissues ( 9 ) . Pulmonary hypertension occurs in up to 33 % of patients with diffuse scleroderma and 10 % to 50 % of those with the crest syndrome ( 10 , 11 ) , in which it is one of the leading causes of death ( 12 , 13 ) . Pulmonary hypertension in the scleroderma spectrum of disease may be associated with interstitial pulmonary fibrosis or may consist of a direct involvement of small and medium-sized pulmonary arteries and arterioles with smooth-muscle hyperplasia , medial hypertrophy , and intimal proliferation ( 10 , 13 , 14 ) . Principal involvement of the pulmonary vasculature is more common in the crest syndrome , whereas patients with pulmonary hypertension and diffuse scleroderma more often have interstitial lung disease ( 13 ) . No therapies have been proven effective for pulmonary hypertension secondary to the scleroderma spectrum of disease . Small numbers of patients have responded to captopril ( 15 ) , nifedipine ( 16 - 20 ) , and prazosin . In a short-term study of intravenous epoprostenol in seven patients with scleroderma ( two with diffuse scleroderma and five with limited scleroderma ) , six had a decrease in mean pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance ( 21 ) . In a small study of pulmonary hypertension secondary to connective tissue disease , long-term infusion therapy with a prostacyclin analogue , iloprost , result ed in improvement in new york heart association ( nyha ) functional class and quality of life but a variable hemodynamic response ( 22 ) . Results from a single-center , uncontrolled study suggest that long-term , continuously infused epoprostenol therapy can produce hemodynamic and symptomatic responses in patients with connective tissue disease who have severe pulmonary hypertension that is refractory to conventional medical therapy ( 23 ) . The rationale for using continuous epoprostenol infusion to treat pulmonary hypertension secondary to the scleroderma spectrum of disease was based on the efficacy of this therapy for primary pulmonary hypertension ( 4 - 8 ) and recognition that scleroderma is a disease characterized by vasospasm and structural changes in the walls of blood vessels . Prostacyclin is a naturally occurring substance produced by vascular endothelium that has vasodilating , antiplatelet aggregation , and cytoprotective effects ( 24 - 33 ) . Endogenous production of prostacyclin is decreased in an animal model of neonatal pulmonary hypertension ( 34 ) and in adult humans with pulmonary hypertension ( 35 ) . Continuous infusion of prostacyclin normalizes plasma markers of endothelial cell injury and platelet aggregation in patients with primary pulmonary hypertension ( 36 ) . Endothelial dysfunction also plays an important role in the vascular manifestations of the scleroderma spectrum of disease ( 37 , 38 ) , including the raynaud phenomenon and digital ischemia , which cause considerable morbidity . Calcium-channel blockers ( 39 - 45 ) , enalapril ( 46 ) , and intermittent intravenous infusions of prostacyclin ( 47 - 49 ) and iloprost ( 50 - 54 ) improve the raynaud phenomenon in some patients . Mixed results have been obtained with oral prostacyclin analogues ( 55 , 56 ) , and a recent multicenter trial of oral iloprost showed no benefit ( 57 ) . The effect of long-term , continuously infused epoprostenol on the severity of the raynaud phenomenon and on digital ulcer counts has not been previously evaluated . Our 12-week multicenter , open-label , r and omized study was design ed to determine whether the beneficial effect of epoprostenol seen in patients with primary pulmonary hypertension could be extended to patients with pulmonary hypertension secondary to the scleroderma spectrum of disease . Our objective was to evaluate the effects of continuous infusion of epoprostenol on exercise capacity in patients with pulmonary hypertension secondary to the scleroderma spectrum of disease . A secondary objective was assessment of the effects of long-term continuous epoprostenol infusion on cardiopulmonary hemodynamics , borg dyspnea score , dyspnea-fatigue rating , nyha functional class , survival , and safety . Vasospastic manifestations , such as the raynaud phenomenon and digital ulcerations , were also followed . Methods patient selection eligible patients had pulmonary hypertension secondary to the scleroderma spectrum of disease in accordance with the inclusion and exclusion criteria summarized in table 1 . For the purpose s of this study , the scleroderma spectrum of disease was defined as systemic sclerosis with diffuse or limited scleroderma ( 58 ) ; systemic sclerosis that overlapped with another connective tissue disease ; or the presence of definite features of systemic sclerosis , including the raynaud phenomenon and positive test result for antinuclear antibody , plus positive test results for anticentromere antibody , anti-scl 70 antibody , or nailfold capillary abnormalities . Systemic sclerosis with limited cutaneous involvement ( the crest syndrome ) was defined as the presence of any three of the following conditions : subcutaneous calcinosis , the raynaud phenomenon , esophageal dysfunction ( defined clinical ly ) , sclerodactyly , or telangectasia . Patients with interstitial lung disease of a more than mild degree were not included in the study because such patients were thought to be less likely to show benefit . Table 1 . Key inclusion and exclusion criteria on the basis of a previous 12-week study of the effects of epoprostenol infusion in patients with severe primary pulmonary hypertension ( 6 ) and using the 6-minute walk test as the primary outcome measure , we calculated that 50 patients per treatment group would provide 80 % power to detect a difference of 50 meters in the average change from baseline , at an level of 0.05 ( two-tailed t-test ) . R and omization and treatment the protocol was approved by the institutional review boards of the 17 participating centers . After giving informed consent , 111 eligible patients were r and omly assigned ( 1:1 ) to receive continuous epoprostenol infusion ( flolan , glaxo wellcome , inc. , research triangle park , north carolina ) plus conventional therapy or to receive conventional therapy alone . Investigators contacted a central r and omization center to obtain treatment assignment , which was based on a stratified r and omized block design . Assignments were stratified on the basis of vasodilator use at baseline ( yes or no ) and exercise capacity at baseline ( 50 to<200 m or 200 m ) and were r and omized within blocks . Fifty-six patients were assigned to receive epoprostenol plus conventional therapy , and 55 patients were assigned to receive conventional therapy alone . Investigators were not blinded to treatment group assignment ; however , independent blinded observers assessed the primary efficacy measure , exercise capacity . Patients taking calcium-channel blockers at study entry continued to take them during the study period . Adjustments in concomitant medications were allowed during the study on the basis of clinical judgment . Patients in both groups were to receive oral anticoagulants during the study ; 94 of the 111 enrolled patients took warfarin . Venous access for epoprostenol infusion ( in the epoprostenol group only ) was obtained by insertion of a permanent indwelling central venous catheter . Epoprostenol was infused continuously by a portable infusion pump ( cadd-1 model 5100 hf , sims deltec , st. Paul , minnesota ) . Patients were instructed in sterile technique , catheter care , and drug preparation and administration . Epoprostenol therapy was initiated at a low dose ( usually 2 ng/kg of body weight per minute ) . During the 12-week study , doses were adjusted on the basis of signs or symptoms consistent with persistent pulmonary hypertension in the absence of intolerable adverse effects ( figure 1 ) . Figure 1 . Epoprostenol dosing . Outcome measures the primary measure of efficacy was exercise capacity , as defined by the distance a patient could walk in 6 minutes . Trained observers at each site who were not otherwise involved in patient care administered the 6-minute walk test . All patients wore an ambulatory infusion pump and a hospital gown over their clothes to mask the presence or absence of a long-term indwelling catheter , thereby blinding testers to the patients ' treatment groups . Each patient performed one practice walk test . A st and ardized , unencouraged 6-minute walk test was performed as described elsewhere ( 59 ) at baseline and at 1 , 6 , and 12 weeks . The 6-minute walk test has been shown to provide meaningful outcome data in assessing potential therapy for patients with pulmonary hypertension ( 6 ) . Secondary measures of efficacy were cardiopulmonary hemodynamics measured by performing right-heart catheterization using st and ard techniques at baseline and week 12 ; the borg dyspnea score ( 60 ) , obtained immediately after completion of the 6-minute walk test at baseline and 1 , 6 , and 12 weeks ( 6 , 59 ) ; the dyspnea-fatigue rating , obtained before the 6-minute walk test at baseline and weeks 1 , 6 , and 12 ( 61 ) ; nyha functional class ( 62 ) , measured at baseline and weeks 1 , 6 , and 12 ; digital ulcer counts , done at baseline and weeks 6 and 12 ; and the severity of the raynaud phenomenon , study4: bosentan treatment for pulmonary arterial hypertension related to connective tissue disease: a subgroup analysis of the pivotal clinical trials and their open-label extensions background : endothelin-1 is considered to be a central pathogenic factor in connective tissue diseases ( ctds ) such as systemic sclerosis ( ssc ) , leading to vasoconstriction , fibrosis , hypertrophy and inflammation . A frequent complication of ctd is pulmonary arterial hypertension ( pah ) , which has a major effect on functioning and quality of life , and is associated with a particularly poor prognosis . Objective : to present a subgroup analysis that summarises experiences from the pivotal studies and their open-label extensions with the oral dual endothelin-1 receptor antagonist bosentan in patients with pah and ctd , mostly ssc and lupus erythematosus . Methods : 66 patients with pah secondary to ctd , in world health organization functional class iii or iv , were r and omised to two double-blind , placebo-controlled studies and followed up for 12 and 16 weeks , respectively . The primary end point was change in exercise capacity , assessed using the 6-min walk test . In both studies and their extensions , survival was assessed from start of treatment to death or data cut-off and analysed as kaplan – meier estimates . Results : 44 patients with pah secondary to ctd who were treated with bosentan were stable in 6-min walk distance at the end of the study ( + 19.5 m , 95 % confidence interval ( ci ) −3.2 to 42.2 ) , whereas patients treated with placebo deteriorated ( −2.6 m , 95 % ci −54.0 to 48.7 ) . 64 patients subsequently received bosentan in an open-label long-term extension study . Mean ( st and ard deviation ( sd ) ) exposure to bosentan was 1.6 ( 0.9 ) years , and duration of observation was 1.8 ( 0.8 ) years . 8 ( 16 % ) patients received epoprostenol as add-on treatment and 7 ( 14 % ) after discontinuation of bosentan . Survival in those receiving bosentan was 85.9 % after 1 year and 73.4 % after 2 years . Conclusion : short-term bosentan treatment in a subgroup of patients with pah secondary to ctd seems to have a favourable effect compared with placebo . The long-term follow-up of these patients suggests that first-line bosentan , with the subsequent addition of other pah treatments if required , is safe for long-term treatment and may have a positive effect on outcome","Conclusions: there was a trend for endothelin receptor antagonists to reduce mortality ( or 0.48 ; 95 % ci 0.21 to 1.09 ) , and limited data suggest that endothelin receptor antagonists improve borg dyspnoea score and cardiopulmonary haemodynamics in symptomatic patients . Hepatic toxicity was not common , and endothelin receptor antagonists were well tolerated in this population . Endothelin receptor antagonists can increase exercise capacity , improve who/nyha functional class , prevent who/nyha functional class deterioration , reduce dyspnoea and improve cardiopulmonary haemodynamic variables in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension with who/nyha functional class ii and iii . However , there was only a trend towards endothelin receptor antagonists reducing mortality in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension . Efficacy data are strongest in those with idiopathic pulmonary hypertension"
Text Summarization,English,"You are an expert medical assistant named Aloe, developed by the High Performance Artificial Intelligence Group at Barcelona Supercomputing Center(BSC). You are to be a helpful, respectful, and honest assistant.","You will be given a background statement and some study titles and abstracts. Your task is to summarize the main conclusions of the studies. Background: background to achieve sufficient myocardial perfusion in st-segment elevation myocardial infa rct ion ( stemi ) patients receiving primary percutaneous coronary intervention ( ppci ) , many adjunctive therapies have been proposed . Previous trials have reported variances in myocardial perfusion improvement for statin pretreatment , which made it inconvincible to confirm the beneficial effects of statins . Therefore , we performed a systematic review and meta- analysis to determine whether statin pretreatment was effective in improving myocardial perfusion . Hypothesis statin pretreatment could improve myocardial perfusion in stemi patients undergoing ppci . Study1: effect of statin therapy before q-wave myocardial infarction on myocardial perfusion. Recent studies emphasized the non-lipid-lowering effects of hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme a reductase inhibitors on endothelial function , inflammation , and platelet activation in patients with stable atherosclerosis . This study sought to evaluate the impact of statin pretreatment in patients with acute myocardial infa rct ion ( ami ) on level of systemic inflammation and myocardial perfusion . A total of 253 consecutive patients undergoing primary angioplasty on a native vessel within 12 hours of ami were divided into a group with statin pretreatment ( n = 86 ) and control patients ( n = 167 ) . Angiographic myocardial blush grade ( mbg ) after revascularization of the infa rct -related artery was determined to evaluate myocardial perfusion . Statin pretreatment was associated with a lower frequency of increased c-reactive protein ( > or=5 mg/l ) on admission compared with the control group ( 48 % vs 64 % ; p = 0.019 ) . The frequency of normal perfusion ( mbg 3 ) was higher in the statin-pretreatment group than the control group ( 45 % vs 26 % , respectively ; p < 0.001 ) . Statin pretreatment was an independent predictor of normal myocardial perfusion ( mbg 3 ; odds ratio 2.53 , 95 % confidence interval 1.15 to 9.53 , p = 0.022 ) in addition to age < or=70 years and c-reactive protein < 5 mg/l. In conclusion , statin pretreatment in patients with ami was associated with decreased systemic inflammation and better perfusion after primary angioplasty of the infa rct -related artery study2: effects of receipt of chronic statin therapy before the onset of acute myocardial infarction: a retrospective study in patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention. Background studies have reported an association between receipt of statin therapy and a reduction in complications after elective percutaneous coronary intervention ( pci ) . However , there are limited data on the effects of chronic statin therapy before the occurrence of an acute myocardial infa rct ion ( ami ) . Objective this study investigated whether administration of chronic statin therapy before ami was associated with a reduction in reperfusion injury in ami patients undergoing pci . Methods this was a retrospective study of consecutive patients with a first ami who underwent successful reperfusion therapy with pci within 24 hours after the onset of ami between april 1998 and october 2003 . Patients were stratified according to whether they had or had not been receiving chronic statin therapy for > or = 1 month before the onset of ami . The following end points were compared after pci : electrocardiographic resolution of st segment elevation , defined as a reduction of > or = 50 % from the initial value ; achievement of thrombolysis in myocardial infa rct ion ( timi ) grade 3 flow ; corrected timi frame count ( ctfc ) ; maximum serum creatine kinase ( ck ) level ; and the type and frequency of ventricular arrhythmias . Results the study enrolled 386 patients , 40 of whom had been receiving statin therapy before the onset of ami . The clinical characteristics of the 2 groups were similar at baseline , with the exceptions of a significantly higher rate of hyperlipidemia in the statin group compared with the nonstatin group ( p < 0.001 ) , significantly greater chronic use of aspirin therapy ( p < 0.001 ) , and significantly greater chronic use of antihypertensive medications ( beta-blockers : p = 0.004 ; angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin ii-receptor blockers : p = 0.007 ; calcium channel blockers : p = 0.006 ) . Electrocardiographic st segment resolution after pci was observed in 87.5 % and 69.9 % of the statin and nonstatin groups , respectively ( hazard ratio [ hr ] : 3.01 ; 95 % ci , 1.15 - 7.90 ; p = 0.025 ) . Achievement of timi grade 3 flow after pci was seen in 95.0 % of the statin group and 83.5 % of the nonstatin group ( hr : 3.75 ; 95 % ci , 0.88 - 16.0 ; p = ns ) . Patients treated with a statin had a significantly lower mean ( sd ) maximum ck level compared with the nonstatin group ( 2300 [ 1449 ] vs 3538 [ 3170 ] iu/ml , respectively ; p = 0.015 ) and a lower ctfc after pci ( 18.8 [ 4.0 ] vs 24.2 [ 14.2 ] ; p = 0.017 ) . The difference in reperfusion arrhythmias between groups was not statistically significant . After adjustment for baseline covariates , pretreatment with a statin was found to be an independent predictor of st segment resolution after pci ( hr : 2.95 ; 95 % ci , 1.08 - 8.09 ; p = 0.035 ) and prevention of impaired coronary flow ( hr : 3.00 ; 95 % ci , 1.63 - 5.55 ; p < 0.001 ) . Conclusion in this study , receipt of chronic statin therapy before the onset of ami was associated with improvement in epicardial perfusion and a reduction in myocardial necrosis after pci study3: early statin treatment prior to primary pci for acute myocardial infarction: reperator, a randomized placebo‐controlled pilot trial objective : the aim of this pilot study was to determine whether early atorvastatin treatment will reduce left ventricle ( lv ) remodeling , infa rct size , and improve microvascular perfusion . Background : in animal studies , early statin therapy reduces reperfusion injury after a percutaneous coronary intervention ( pci ) for acute myocardial infa rct ion ( ami ) . Methods : forty‐two consecutive patients ( 82 % male , mean age 61.2 ± 9.8 ) who underwent a primary pci for a first st‐elevated ami were r and omized for pretreatment with atorvastatin 80 mg ( n = 20 ) or placebo ( n = 22 ) and continued with the same dosage daily for 1 week . All patients received atorvastatin 80 mg once daily 7 days after primary pci . The lv function and infa rct size were measured by magnetic resonance imaging within 1 day , at 1 week , and 3 months follow up . The primary endpoint was the end‐systolic volume index ( esvi ) at 3 months . Secondary endpoints were global lv function measurements , myocardial infa rct size , biochemical cardiac markers , timi flow , and st‐t elevation resolution . Results : esvi 3 months after ami was 25.1 ml/m2 in the atorvastatin arm and 25.0 ml/m2 in the placebo arm ( p = 0.74 ) . The differences in change from baseline to 3 months follow up in global lv function and myocardial infa rct size did not differ between both treatment arms . Furthermore , biochemical markers , timi flow , and st‐t elevation resolution did not differ between atorvastatin and placebo arm . Conclusions : in this pilot study , pretreatment with atorvastatin in an acute myocardial infa rct ion does not result in an improved cardiac function , microvascular perfusion , or decreased myocardial infa rct size . © 2012 wiley periodicals study4: impact of chronic statin-pretreatment on myocardial damage as assessed by cardiac magnetic resonance findings in patients with acute st-elevation myocardial infarction background recent data have demonstrated a lower mortality in acute st-elevation myocardial infa rct ion ( stemi ) patients with previous treatment with statins , especially in patients with high risk profiles . Moreover , a significant reduction in enzymatic infa rct size in non-stemi patients could be observed . However , systematic data of the impact of chronic statin pre-treatment on myocardial damage and reperfusion injury assessed with the gold st and ard cardiac magnetic resonance imaging ( cmr ) are lacking . The aim of our prospect i ve study was therefore to assess the effects of a chronic statin pre-treatment on myocardial damage as assessed by cmr in patients with acute reperfused stemi . Study5: impact of microvascular dysfunction on left ventricular remodeling and long-term clinical outcome after primary coronary angioplasty for acute myocardial infarction background —we hypothesized that preserved microvascular integrity in the area at risk would favorably influence left ventricular ( lv ) remodeling and long-term outcome after acute myocardial infa rct ion . Methods and results —before and after successful primary angioplasty ( percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty [ ptca ] ) , 124 patients with acute myocardial infa rct ion underwent intracoronary myocardial contrast echo ( mce ) . An mce score index ( mcesi ) was derived by averaging the single-segment score ( 0=not visible , 1=patchy , 2=homogeneous contrast effect ) within the area at risk . An mcesi ≥1 was considered adequate reperfusion . Mean follow-up was 46±32 months . After ptca , 100 patients showed adequate reperfusion ( no microvascular dysfunction , nomd ) , whereas 24 did not ( md ) . Md patients had a higher mean creatine kinase ( 4153±2422 versus 2743±1774 u/l ; p = 0.002 ) and baseline wall-motion score index ( 2.61±0.31 versus 2.25±0.42 ; p < 0.001 ) and a lower baseline ejection fraction ( 33±8 % versus 40±7 % ; p < 0.001 ) . From day 1 on , lv volumes progressively increased in the md patients ( n=19 ) and were larger than those of nomd patients ( n=85 ) at 6 months ( end-diastolic volume 170±55 versus 115±29 ml ; p < 0.001 ) . Mcesi was the most important independent predictor of lv dilation ( or 0.61 , 95 % ci 0.52 to 0.71 , p < 0.000001 ) . By cox analysis , md represented the only predictor of cardiac death ( or 0.26 , 95 % ci 0.09 to 0.72 , p = 0.010 ) and combined events ( cardiac death , reinfa rct ion , and heart failure ; or 0.44 , 95 % ci 0.23 to 0.85 , p = 0.014 ) . Md patients showed worse survival in terms of cardiac death ( p < 0.0001 ) and combined events ( p < 0.0001 ) . Conclusions —in reperfused acute myocardial infa rct ion , md within the risk area is an important predictor of both lv remodeling and unfavorable long-term outcome study6: effects of atorvastatin pretreatment on infarct size in patients with st-segment elevation myocardial infarction undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention. Background atorvastatin pretreatment has been reported to reduce myocardial damage in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention ( pci ) . We sought to investigate the effect of atorvastatin pretreatment on infa rct size in patients with st-segment elevation myocardial infa rct ion ( stemi ) . Methods patients undergoing primary pci for st-segment elevation myocardial infa rct ion within 12 hours after symptom onset were r and omized to an atorvastatin group ( 80 mg before pci and for 5 days after pci [ n = 89 ] ) or a control group ( 10 mg daily after pci [ n = 84 ] ) . The primary end point was infa rct size measured by technetium tc 99 m tetrofosmin single-photon emission computed tomography between days 5 and 14 . Results baseline clinical , angiographic , and procedural characteristics were not significantly different between groups except for age and current smoking status . There was no significant difference in infa rct size ( as a percentage of the left ventricle ) between groups ( 22.2 % ± 15.5 % in the atorvastatin group vs 21.6 % ± 15.4 % in the control group , p = .79 ) . The median infa rct size was 19.0 % ( interquartile range 9.0 - 32.0 ) in the atorvastatin group and 18.0 % ( 9.3 - 32.5 ) in the control group ( p = .76 ) . Achievement of myocardial blush grade 2/3 and complete st-segment resolution at 60 minutes after pci occurred with similar frequency ( 72.8 % vs 81.9 % , p = .33 and 43.2 % vs 47.5 % , p = .57 , respectively ) . Conclusions pretreatment with high-dose atorvastatin followed by further treatment for 5 days did not reduce infa rct size measured by single-photon emission computed tomography in patients undergoing primary pci study7: use of statins prior to percutaneous coronary intervention reduces myonecrosis and improves clinical outcome primary and secondary prevention with statins reduce major cardiac events in patients with coronary artery disease . The impact of pretreatment with statins prior to percutaneous coronary intervention ( pci ) is not well established . The objective of this study was to determine if pretreatment with statins prior to pci reduce myonecrosis and improve clinical outcome . One hundred nineteen consecutive patients with acute coronary syndrome who underwent pci were identified . We compared the incidence of myonecrosis defined as peak elevation of ck‐mb or ck three time above upper limit of normal within 24 hr and the 6‐month cardiovascular event rate ( death , nonfatal myocardial infa rct ion unrelated to pci , target vessels revascularization , and unstable angina requiring hospitalization ) among patients who received statins prior to pci ( n = 63 ) to those who did not ( n = 56 ) . Pretreated patients were more likely to have history of myocardial infa rct ion or revascularization ( 63 % vs. 43 % ; p = 0.015 ) , hyperlipidemia ( 80 % vs. 48 % ; p = 0.001 ) , hypertension ( 83 % vs. 49 % ; p = 0.02 ) , and use of angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitor ( 62 % vs. 38 % ; p = 0.008 ) . The rest of baseline characteristics were similar between the two groups , including use of glycoprotein iib/iiia inhibitors , number of diseased vessels , and type of lesions . Patients pretreated with statins had a significantly lower incidence of myonecrosis ( 2 % vs. 10 % ; p = 0.04 ) at 24 hr and a significantly lower clinical event ( ce ) rate at 6 months ( 17 % vs. 21 % ; p = 0.015 ) . Of patients not pretreated with statins , 72 % were taking statins at 6 months as compared to 98 % of pretreated patients . After adjusting for all baseline characteristics , use of statins prior to pci was associated with a marked decrease in risk of all ces ( or = 0.2 ; ci = 0.06–0.63 ; p = 0.006 ) . Statin therapy prior to pci may reduces peri‐pci myonecrosis and late cardiac events . These results need to be confirmed in large prospect i ve r and omized trials .

Objectives this study sought to determine the efficacy of high-dose atorvastatin in patients with st-segment elevation myocardial infa rct ion ( stemi ) undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention ( pci ) . Background previous r and omized trials have demonstrated that statin pre-treatment reduced major adverse cardiac events ( maces ) in patients with stable angina pectoris and acute coronary syndrome . However , no r and omized studies have been carried out with stemi patients in a primary pci setting . Methods a total 171 patients with stemi were r and omized to 80-mg atorvastatin ( n = 86 ) or 10-mg atorvastatin ( n = 85 ) arms for pre-treatment before pci . All patients were prescribed clopidogrel ( 600 mg ) before pci . After pci , both groups were treated with atorvastatin ( 10 mg ) . The primary end point was 30-day incidence of mace including death , nonfatal mi , and target vessel revascularization . Secondary end points included corrected thrombolysis in myocardial infa rct ion frame count , myocardial blush grade , and st-segment resolution at 90 min after pci . Results mace occurred in 5 ( 5.8 % ) and 9 ( 10.6 % ) patients in the 80-mg and 10-mg atorvastatin pre-treatment arms , respectively ( p = 0.26 ) . Corrected thrombolysis in myocardial infa rct ion frame count was lower in the 80-mg atorvastatin arm ( 26.9 + /- 12.3 vs. 34.1 + /- 19.0 , p = 0.01 ) . Myocardial blush grade and st-segment resolution were also higher in the 80-mg atorvastatin arm ( 2.2 + /- 0.8 vs. 1.9 + /- 0.8 , p = 0.02 and 61.8 + /- 26.2 vs. 50.6 + /- 25.8 % , p = 0.01 ) . Conclusions high-dose atorvastatin pre-treatment before pci did not show a significant reduction of maces compared with low-dose atorvastatin but did show improved immediate coronary flow after primary pci . High-dose atorvastatin may produce an optimal result for stemi patients undergoing pci by improving microvascular myocardial perfusion . ( efficacy of high-dose atorvastatin loading before primary percutaneous coronary intervention in st-elevation myocardial infa rct ion [ statin stemi ] ; nct00808717 ) study9: relationship of timi myocardial perfusion grade to mortality after administration of thrombolytic drugs. Background although improved epicardial blood flow ( as assessed with either timi flow grade s or timi frame count ) has been related to reduced mortality after administration of thrombolytic drugs , the relationship of myocardial perfusion ( as assessed on the coronary arteriogram ) to mortality has not been examined . Methods and results a new , simple angiographic method , the timi myocardial perfusion ( tmp ) grade , was used to assess the filling and clearance of contrast in the myocardium in 762 patients in the timi ( thrombolysis in myocardial infa rct ion ) 10b trial , and its relationship to mortality was examined . Tmp grade 0 was defined as no apparent tissue-level perfusion ( no ground-glass appearance of blush or opacification of the myocardium ) in the distribution of the culprit artery ; tmp grade 1 indicates presence of myocardial blush but no clearance from the microvasculature ( blush or a stain was present on the next injection ) ; tmp grade 2 blush clears slowly ( blush is strongly persistent and diminishes minimally or not at all during 3 cardiac cycles of the washout phase ) ; and tmp grade 3 indicates that blush begins to clear during washout ( blush is minimally persistent after 3 cardiac cycles of washout ) . There was a mortality gradient across the tmp grade s , with mortality lowest in those patients with tmp grade 3 ( 2.0 % ) , intermediate in tmp grade 2 ( 4.4 % ) , and highest in tmp grade s 0 and 1 ( 6.0 % ; 3-way p=0.05 ) . Even among patients with timi grade 3 flow in the epicardial artery , the tmp grade s allowed further risk stratification of 30-day mortality : 0.73 % for tmp grade 3 ; 2.9 % for tmp grade 2 ; 5.0 % for tmp grade 0 or 1 ( p=0.03 for tmp grade 3 versus grade s 0 , 1 , and 2 ; 3-way p=0.066 ) . Tmp grade 3 flow was a multivariate correlate of 30-day mortality ( or 0.35 , 95 % ci 0.12 to 1.02 , p=0.054 ) in a multivariate model that adjusted for the presence of timi 3 flow ( p = ns ) , the corrected timi frame count ( or 1.02 , p=0.06 ) , the presence of an anterior myocardial infa rct ion ( or 2.3 , p=0.03 ) , pulse rate on admission ( p = ns ) , female sex ( p = ns ) , and age ( or 1.1 , p<0.001 ) . Conclusions impaired perfusion of the myocardium on coronary arteriography by use of the tmp grade is related to a higher risk of mortality after administration of thrombolytic drugs that is independent of flow in the epicardial artery . Patients with both normal epicardial flow ( timi grade 3 flow ) and normal tissue level perfusion ( tmp grade 3 ) have an extremely low risk of mortality study10: relation between neutrophil counts on admission, microvascular injury, and left ventricular functional recovery in patients with an anterior wall first acute myocardial infarction treated with primary coronary angioplasty. Increased neutrophil counts have been associated with an increased risk of adverse clinical events after acute myocardial infa rct ion ( ami ) . We examined the association of neutrophil counts on admission with degree of microvascular injury and left ventricular functional recovery after primary coronary angioplasty in ami . We studied 116 patients with a first anterior wall ami who underwent primary coronary angioplasty within 12 hours of onset . Patients were categorized into 3 groups based on initial neutrophil count : low ( < 5,000/mm(3 ) ) , intermediate ( 5,000 to 10,000/mm(3 ) ) , and high ( > 10,000/mm(3 ) ) . Coronary flow velocity parameters were assessed immediately after reperfusion using a doppler guidewire . We defined severe microvascular injury as the presence of systolic flow reversal and a diastolic deceleration time < 600 ms . Echocardiographic wall motion was analyzed before revascularization and 4 weeks after revascularization . In patients with a high neutrophil count , systolic flow reversal was more frequently observed , diastolic deceleration time was shorter , and coronary flow reserve was lower . By regression analysis , neutrophil count significantly correlated with diastolic deceleration time ( r = -0.38 , p < 0.0001 ) , coronary flow reserve ( r = -0.33 , p = 0.0004 ) , and score for change in wall motion ( r = -0.36 , p = 0.0004 ) . Multivariate analysis showed that neutrophil count on admission was an independent predictor of severe microvascular injury ( odds ratio 2.94 , p = 0.02 ) . In conclusion , neutrophilia on admission is associated with impaired microvascular reperfusion and poor functional recovery after primary coronary angioplasty",Conclusions: this present meta- analysis suggests that statin pretreatment might be effective in improving myocardial perfusion in stemi patients

Your task is to summarize the main conclusions of the studies. Background: waterpipe tobacco smoking is growing in popularity despite adverse health effects among users . We systematic ally review ed the literature , search ing medline , embase and web of science , for interventions targeting prevention and cessation of waterpipe tobacco smoking . Study1: effect of cessation interventions on hookah smoking: post-hoc analysis of a cluster-randomized controlled trial. Introduction we explored the differential effect of cessation interventions ( behavioral support sessions with [ bss+ ] and without [ bss ] bupropion ) between hookah and cigarette smokers . Methods we reanalyzed the data from a major cluster-r and omized controlled trial , assist ( action to stop smoking in suspected tuberculosis ) , which consisted of 3 conditions : ( a ) behavioral support sessions ( bss ) , ( b ) behavioral support sessions plus 7 weeks of bupropion therapy ( bss+ ) , and ( c ) controls receiving usual care . The trial originally recruited 1,955 adult smokers with suspected tuberculosis from 33 health centers in the jhang and sargodha districts of pakistan between 2010 and 2011 . The primary endpoint was continuous 6-month smoking abstinence , which was determined by carbon monoxide levels . Subgroup-specific relative risks ( rrs ) of smoking abstinence were computed and tested for differential intervention effect using log binomial regression ( generalized linear model ) between 3 subgroups ( cigarette-only : 1,255 ; mixed : 485 ; and hookah-only : 215 ) . Results the test result for homogeneity of intervention effects between the smoking forms was statistically significant ( p-value for bss+ : .04 and for bss : .02 ) . Compared to the control , both interventions appeared to be effective among hookah smokers ( rr = 2.5 ; 95 % ci = 1.3 - 4.7 and rr = 2.2 ; 95 % ci = 1.3 - 3.8 , respectively ) but less effective among cigarette smokers ( rr = 6.6 ; 95 % ci = 4.6 - 9.6 and rr = 5.8 ; 95 % ci = 4.0 - 8.5 ) , respectively . Conclusions the differential intervention effects on hookah and cigarette smokers were seen ( a ) because the behavioral support intervention was design ed primarily for cigarette smokers ; ( b ) because of differences in demographic characteristics , behavioral , and sociocultural determinants ; or ( c ) because of differences in nicotine dependency levels between the 2 groups study2: behavioral cessation treatment of waterpipe smoking: the first pilot randomized controlled trial. Background waterpipe use has increased dramatically in the middle east and other parts of the world . Many users exhibit signs of dependence , including withdrawal and difficulty quitting , but there is no evidence base to guide cessation efforts . Methods we developed a behavioral cessation program for willing-to-quit waterpipe users , and evaluated its feasibility and efficacy in a pilot , two arm , parallel group , r and omized , open label trial in aleppo , syria . Fifty adults who smoked waterpipe ≥3 times per week in the last year , did not smoke cigarettes , and were interested in quitting were r and omized to receive either brief ( 1 in-person session and 3 phone calls ) or intensive ( 3 in-person sessions and 5 phone calls ) behavioral cessation treatment delivered by a trained physician in a clinical setting . The primary efficacy end point of the developed interventions was prolonged abstinence at three months post-quit day , assessed by self-report and exhaled carbon monoxide levels of < 10 ppm . Secondary end points were 7 day point-prevalent abstinence and adherence to treatment . Results thirty percent of participants were fully adherent to treatment , which did not vary by treatment group . The proportions of participants in the brief and intensive interventions with prolonged abstinence at the 3-month assessment were 30.4 % and 44.4 % , respectively . Previous success in quitting ( or=3.57 ; 95 % ci=1.03 - 12.43 ) predicted cessation . Higher baseline readiness to quit , more confidence in quitting , and being unemployed predicted a better adherence to treatment ( all p-values < 0.05 ) . Conclusions brief behavioral cessation treatment for waterpipe users appears to be feasible and effective study3: waterpipe tobacco smoking prevalence and correlates in 25 eastern mediterranean and eastern european countries: cross-sectional analysis of the global youth tobacco survey. Introduction waterpipe tobacco smoking is highly prevalent among young people in some setting s. There is an absence of nationally representative prevalence studies of waterpipe tobacco use and dual use with other tobacco products in young people . Methods we conducted a secondary analysis of the global youth tobacco survey , a nationally representative cross-sectional study of students aged 13 - 15 years . Of 180 participating countries , 25 included optional waterpipe tobacco smoking questions : 15 eastern mediterranean and 10 eastern european countries . We calculated the prevalence of current ( past 30-day ) waterpipe tobacco use , including dual waterpipe and other tobacco use , and used logistic regression models to identify sociodemographic correlates of waterpipe tobacco smoking . Individual country results were combined in a r and om effects meta- analysis . Results waterpipe tobacco smoking prevalence was highest in lebanon ( 36.9 % ) , the west bank ( 32.7 % ) and parts of eastern europe ( latvia 22.7 % , the czech republic 22.1 % , estonia 21.9 % ) . These countries also recorded greater than 10 % prevalence of dual waterpipe and cigarette use . In a meta- analysis , higher odds of waterpipe tobacco smoking were found among males ( adjusted odds ratio [ aor ] = 1.37 , 95 % confidence interval [ ci ] = 1.18 % to 1.59 % ) , cigarette users ( aor = 6.95 , 95 % ci = 5.74 % to 8.42 % ) , those whose parents ( aor = 1.54 , 95 % ci = 1.31 % to 1.82 % ) or peers smoked ( aor = 3.53 , 95 % ci = 2.97 % to 4.20 % ) and those whose parents had higher educational attainment ( father , aor = 1.47 , 95 % ci = 1.14 % to 1.89 % ; mother , aor = 1.62 , 95 % ci = 1.07 % to 2.46 % ) . We report on regional- and country income-level differences . Conclusions waterpipe tobacco smoking , including dual waterpipe and cigarette use , is alarmingly high in several eastern mediterranean and eastern european countries . Ongoing waterpipe tobacco smoking surveillance is warranted study4: study of secondhand smoke levels pre and post implementation of the comprehensive smoking ban in mumbai objectives : this research was undertaken with the aim of assessing the indoor air quality in popular hospitality venues , as also to evaluate the effectiveness of the nationwide comprehensive public smoking ban . The analysis was split into two halves – baseline study taken up prior to implementation of the said ban on 2nd october 2008 , and the follow-up study after it came into effect . Material s and methods : twenty-five venues including five restaurants , fourteen resto-bars , two hookah ( smoking water-pipe ) cafes and four pubs were selected using a mix of r and om , convenience and purpose ful sampling . Particulate matter ( pm2.5 ) measurements at these venues were made using tsi sidepak am510 personal aerosol monitor . Results : the average pm2.5 level in venues where smoking was permitted prior to implementation of ban was found to be 669.95 μg/m3 in the baseline study . Post ban , the average pm2.5 level in same test venues reduced to 240.8 μg/m3 . The hookah cafes were an exception as the average pm2.5 levels exceeded the permissible limits before as well as post ban . Conclusion : the baseline study showed that the hospitality venues had hazardous levels of pm2.5 particles arising from second-h and smoke prior to smoking ban . These decreased by a maximum of 64 % after the law took effect . A substantial improvement in air quality at these venues post implementation of the smoking ban indicated the effectiveness of the law study5: a web-based program to increase knowledge and reduce cigarette and nargila smoking among arab university students in israel: mixed-methods study to test acceptability background among arab citizens in israel , cigarette and nargila ( hookah , waterpipe ) smoking is a serious public health problem , particularly among the young adult population . With the dramatic increase of internet and computer use among arab college and university students , a web-based program may provide an easy , accessible tool to reduce smoking rates without heavy re source dem and s required by traditional methods . Objective the purpose of this research was to examine the acceptability and feasibility of a pilot web-based program that provides tailored feedback to increase smoking knowledge and reduce cigarette and nargila smoking behaviors among arab college/university students in israel . Methods a pilot web-based program was developed , consisting of a self-administered question naire and feedback system on cigarette and nargila smoking . Arab university students were recruited to participate in a mixed- methods study , using both quantitative ( pre-/posttest study design ) and qualitative tools . A posttest was implemented at 1 month following participation in the intervention to assess any changes in smoking knowledge and behaviors . Focus group sessions were implemented to assess acceptability and preferences related to the web-based program . Results a total of 225 participants —response rate of 63.2 % (225/356)—completed the intervention at baseline and at 1-month post study , and were used for the comparative analysis . Statistically significant reductions in nargila smoking among participants ( p=.001 ) were found . The intervention did not result in reductions in cigarette smoking . However , the tailored web intervention result ed in statistically significant increases in the intention to quit smoking ( p=.021 ) . No statistically significant increases in knowledge were seen at 1-month post study . Participants expressed high satisfaction with the intervention and 93.8 % ( 211/225 ) of those who completed the intervention at both time intervals reported that they would recommend the program to their friends , indicating excellent acceptability and feasibility of the intervention . This was further emphasized in the focus group sessions . Conclusions a tailored web-based program may be a promising tool to reduce nargila smoking among arab university students in israel . The tailored web intervention was not successful at significantly reducing cigarette smoking or increasing knowledge . However , the intervention did increase participants ' intention to quit smoking . Participants considered the web-based tool to be an interesting , feasible , and highly acceptable strategy . Trial registration trial registration : is rct n registry is rct n59207794 ; rct n.Com/is rct n59207794 ( archived by webcite at ) study6: a randomized, controlled community-wide intervention to reduce environmental tobacco smoke exposure. Introduction tobacco use in low- to middle-income countries is a major public health concern for both smokers and those exposed to environmental tobacco smoke ( ets ) . Egypt has made important strides in controlling tobacco use , but smoking and ets remain highly prevalent . This r and omized intervention sought to improve the target population 's knowledge regarding the hazards of smoking and ets and to change attitudes and smoking behaviors within the community and the household . Methods in this 2005 - 2006 study in egypt 's qalyubia governorate , trained professionals visited schools , households , mosques , and health care centers in rural villages r and omly selected for the intervention to discuss the adverse effects of smoking and ets exposure and ways to reduce one 's ets exposure . Data collected in interviewer-facilitated surveys before and after the intervention period were analyzed in pairwise comparisons with data from control villages to assess the effectiveness of the intervention in achieving its aims . Results the intervention group showed a greater increase in underst and ing the dangers associated with smoking cigarettes and waterpipes and became more proactive in limiting ets exposure by asking smokers to stop , avoiding areas with ets , and enacting smoking bans in the home . However , the intervention had little to no impact on the number of smokers and the amount of tobacco smoked . Conclusions results are consistent with previous studies showing that changing smokers ' behavior can be difficult , but community-wide efforts to reduce ets exposure through smoking bans , education , and empowering people to ask smokers to stop are effective . The method can be generalized to other setting study7: patterns of water-pipe and cigarette smoking initiation in schoolchildren: irbid longitudinal smoking study. Introduction tobacco use remains a major public health problem worldwide . Water-pipe smoking is spreading rapidly and threatening to undermine the successes achieved in tobacco control . Methods a school-based longitudinal study in the city of irbid , jordan , was performed from 2008 to 2010 . All seventh- grade students in 19 r and omly selected schools , out of a total of 60 schools in the city , were enrolled at baseline and surveyed annually . Results of the 1781 students enrolled at baseline 1,701 ( 95.5 % ) were still in the study at the end of the second year of follow-up ( 869 boys , median age at baseline 13 years ) . Ever and current water-pipe smoking were higher than those of cigarette smoking at baseline ( ever smoking : 25.9 % vs. 17.6 % and current smoking : 13.3 % vs. 5.3 % for water-pipe and cigarette smoking , respectively ; p < .01 for both ) but cigarette smoking caught up by the second year of follow-up ( ever smoking : 46.4 % vs. 44.7 % ; p = .32 and current smoking : 18.9 % vs. 14.9 % ; p < .01 ) . Water pipe-only smokers at baseline were twice as likely to become current cigarette smokers after 2 years compared with never smokers ( relative risk ( rr ) = 2.1 ; 95 % ci = 1.2 , 3.4 ) . A similar pattern was observed for cigarette-only smokers at baseline ( rr = 2.0 ; 95 % ci = 0.9 , 4.8 ) . Conclusions prevalence of water-pipe and cigarette smoking increased dramatically over the 2-year follow-up period with similar patterns in boys and girls , although girls had lower prevalence in all categories . Water-pipe smoking at baseline predicted the progress to cigarette smoking in the future and vice versa","Conclusions: in conclusion , there is a lack of evidence of effectiveness for most waterpipe interventions"

Study1: sexuality and sexual life in women with spinal cord injury: a controlled study. Objective to describe sexual life in women with spinal cord injury . Design controlled cross-sectional , question naire . Participants and methods women , 18 - 65 years , treated at spinal cord centres in sweden , denmark , norway , finl and and icel and . 545 women ( 57 % ) completed the question naires . The age-matched control group consisted of 507 women . The 104-item spinal cord injury women question naire , was design ed to assess different dimensions of sexuality . Results 80 % of the women with spinal cord injury had engaged in sex after the injury . Reasons for not wanting or not having the courage to be intimate and sexual were physical problems , low sexual desire , low self-esteem and feelings of being unattractive . The motivations of both the women with spinal cord injury and controls to engage in sexual activity were intimacy-based rather than primarily sexual . Being in the right mood both before and during sex to become receptive to sexual stimulation was important . Conclusion for women who are able to overcome the physical restrictions and mental obstacles due to injury , it is possible to regain an active and positive sexual life together with a partner .

Your task is to summarize the main conclusions of the studies. Background: introduction surgical stress in the presence of fasting worsens the catabolic state , causes insulin resistance and may delay recovery . Carbohydrate rich drinks given preoperatively may ameliorate these deleterious effects . A systematic review was undertaken to analyse the effect of preoperative carbohydrate loading on insulin resistance , gastric emptying , gastric acidity , patient wellbeing , immunity and nutrition following surgery . Study1: randomized clinical trial of the effect of preoperative oral carbohydrate treatment on postoperative whole‐body protein and glucose kinetics preoperative oral carbohydrate ( cho ) reduces postoperative insulin resistance . In this r and omized trial , the effect of cho on postoperative whole‐body protein turnover was studied study2: large volumes of apple juice preoperatively do not affect gastric ph and volume in children the effect on gastric ph and volume of 0 , 6 and 10 ml · kg−1 , of apple juice given 2.5 hours before surgery to children aged five to ten years was investigated in this prospect i ve , r and omized , single-blind study . Gastric contents were aspirated after induction of anaesthesia , and the volume measured . The ph of the gastric aspirate was then assessed using ph paper . Neither gastric volume nor ph immediately following the induction of general anaesthesia were significantly different among the three groups . Gastric volumes after 0 , 6 and 10 ml · kg−1 , of juice averaged ( mean ±sd ) 0.45 ±0.31 , 0.66 ±0.79 and 0.71 ±0.76 ml · kg−1 , respectively ; gastric ph averaged 1.7 ±0.6 , 1.7 ±0.6 and 1.8 ±0.8 , respectively . On the basis of questions asked immediately before induction of anaesthiesia , patients who drank 6 ml · kg−1 of apple juice had decreased thirst and were less irritable and upset before anaesthesia than those who had not ( p < 0.05 ) . It is concluded that drinking large volumes of clear apple juice 2.5 hours before scheduled surgery does not have a measurable effect on gastric volume and ph and may offer benefits such as improved patient comfort . Résumél'effet sur le volume et le ph gastrique de 0,6 et 10 ml · kg−1 de jus de pomme donné 2.5 heures avant la chirurgie aux enfants âgés de cinq à dix ans a été investigué dans cette étude prospect i ve r and omisée et a simple insu . Le contenu gastrique fut aspiré après induction de l'anesthésie et le volume mesuré . Le ph du sue gastrique aspiré a par la suite été évalué par un papier à ph. Ni le volume gastrique ni son ph n'était significativement différent pour les trois groupes après l'induction de l'anesthesie générale . Le volume gastrique après 0,6 et 10 ml · kg−1 de jus de pomme était en moyenne ( moyenne ±sd ) respectivement 0,45 ±0,31 , 0,66 ±0,79 et 0,71 ±0,76 ml · kg−1 , en moyenne le ph gastrique était de 1,7 ±0,6 , 1,7 ±0,6 et 1,8 ±0,8 . Pour les avoir question né immédiatement avant l'induction de l'anesthésie les patients ayant bu 6 ml · kg−1 de jus de pomme avaient moins soif et étaient moins irritables avant l'anesthésie que ceux qui n'en ont pas eu ( p < 0.05 ) . On conclut que l'ingestion dun large volume de jus de pomme 2.5 heures avant la chirurgie n'a pas d'effet mesurable sur le volume et le ph gastrique et peut offrir des bénéfices tel que l'amélioration du confort du patient study3: randomized clinical trial of the effects of oral preoperative carbohydrates on postoperative nausea and vomiting after laparoscopic cholecystectomy a carbohydrate‐rich drink ( cho ) has been shown to reduce preoperative discomfort . It was hypothesized that it may also reduce postoperative nausea and vomiting ( ponv ) study4: effect of ""preoperative"" oral carbohydrate treatment on insulin action--a randomised cross-over unblinded study in healthy subjects. Background and aims preoperative intake of a clear carbohydrate-rich drink reduces insulin resistance after surgery . In this study , we evaluated whether this could be related to increased insulin sensitivity at the onset of surgery . Furthermore , we aim ed to establish the optimal dose-regimen . Methods six healthy volunteers underwent hyperinsulinaemic ( 0.8 mu/kg/min ) , normoglycaemic ( 4.5 mmol/l ) clamps and indirect calorimetry on four occasions in a crossover-r and omised order ; after overnight fasting ( cc ) , after a single evening dose ( 800 ml ) of the drink ( lc ) , after a single morning dose ( 400 ml , cl ) and after intake of the drink in the evening and in the morning before the clamp ( ll ) . Data are presented as mean+/-sd . Statistical analysis was performed using the student 's t-test and anova . Results insulin sensitivity was higher in cl and ll ( 9.2+/-1.5 and 9.3+/-1.9 mg/kg/min , respectively ) compared to cc and lc ( 6.1+/-1.6 and 6.6+/-1.9 mg/kg/min , p<0.01 vs. Cl and ll ) . Conclusions a carbohydrate-rich drink enhances insulin action 3 h later by approximately 50 % . Enhanced insulin action to normal postpr and ial day-time level at the time of onset of anaesthesia or surgery is likely to , at least partly , explain the effects on postoperative insulin resistance study5: preoperative oral carbohydrates and postoperative insulin resistance. Unlabelled infusions of carbohydrates before surgery have been shown to reduce postoperative insulin resistance . Presently , we investigated the effects of a carbohydrate drink , given shortly before surgery , on postoperative insulin sensitivity . Methods insulin sensitivity and glucose turnover ( [ 6 , 6,(2)h(2)]-d-glucose ) were measured using hyper-insulinemic , normoglycemic clamps before and after elective surgery . Sixteen patients undergoing total hip replacement were r and omly assigned to preoperative oral carbohydrate administration ( cho-h , n = 8) or the same amount of a placebo drink ( placebo , n = 8) before surgery . Insulin sensitivity was measured before and immediately after surgery . Patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery were studied before surgery and 24 h postoperatively ( cho-c ( n = 7 ) , and fasted ( n = 7 ) , groups ) . The fasted group underwent surgery after an overnight fast . In both studies , the cho groups received 800 ml of an isoosmolar carbohydrate rich beverage the evening before the operation ( 100 g carbohydrates ) , as well as another 400 ml ( 50 g carbohydrates ) 2 h before the initiation of anesthesia . Results immediately after surgery , insulin sensitivity was reduced 37 % in the placebo group ( p < 0.05 vs. Preoperatively ) while no significant change was found in the cho-h group ( -16 % , p = ns ) . During clamps performed 24h postoperatively , insulin sensitivity and whole-body glucose disposal was reduced in both groups , but the reduction was greater compared to that in the cho-c group ( -49 + /- 6 % vs. -26 + /- 8 % , p > > 0.05 fasted vs. Cho-c ) . Conclusions patients given a carbohydrate drink shortly before elective surgery displayed less reduced insulin sensitivity after surgery as compared to patients undergoing surgery after an overnight fast study6: randomized controlled trial of preoperative oral carbohydrate treatment in major abdominal surgery major surgery is associated with postoperative insulin resistance which is attenuated by preoperative carbohydrate ( cho ) treatment . The effect of this treatment on clinical outcome after major abdominal surgery has not been assessed in a double‐blind r and omized trial study7: effect of preoperative intravenous carbohydrate loading on preoperative discomfort in elective surgery patients background and objective we studied the effect of three different fasting protocol s on preoperative discomfort and glucose and insulin levels . Methods two hundred and ten asa i – iii patients undergoing general or gastrointestinal surgery were r and omly assigned to three groups : overnight intravenous 5 % glucose infusion ( 1000 ml ) , carbohydrate-rich drink ( 400 ml ) at 6–7 a.M. , or overnight fasting . The subjective feelings of thirst , hunger , mouth dryness , weakness , tiredness , anxiety , headache and pain of each patient were question ed preoperatively using a visual analogue scale . Serum glucose and insulin levels were measured at predetermined time points preoperatively . Results during the waiting period before surgery , the carbohydrate-rich drink group was less hungry than the fasting group ( p = 0.011 ) . No other differences were seen in visual analogue scale scores among the study groups . Trend analysis showed increasing thirst , mouth dryness and anxiety in the intravenous glucose group ( p < 0.05 ) . The carbohydrate-rich drink group experienced decreasing thirst but increasing hunger and mouth dryness ( p < 0.05 ) . In the fasting group , thirst , hunger , mouth dryness , weakness , tiredness and anxiety increased ( p < 0.05 ) . Both intravenous and oral carbohydrate caused a significant increase in glucose and insulin levels . Conclusion intravenous glucose infusion does not decrease the sense of thirst and hunger as effectively as a carbohydrate-rich drink but does alleviate the feelings of weakness and tiredness compared with fasting study8: continuous intravenous insulin infusion reduces the incidence of deep sternal wound infection in diabetic patients after cardiac surgical procedures. Background diabetes mellitus is a risk factor for deep sternal wound infection after open heart surgical procedures . We previously showed that elevated postoperative blood glucose levels are a predictor of deep sternal wound infection in diabetic patients . Therefore , we hypothesized that aggressive intravenous pharmacologic control of postoperative blood glucose levels would reduce the incidence of deep sternal wound infection . Methods in a prospect i ve study of 2,467 consecutive diabetic patients who underwent open heart surgical procedures between 1987 and 1997 , perioperative blood glucose levels were recorded every 1 to 2 hours . Patients were classified into two sequential groups : the control group included 968 patients treated with sliding-scale-guided intermittent subcutaneous insulin injections ( sqi ) ; the study group included 1,499 patients treated with a continuous intravenous insulin infusion in an attempt to maintain a blood glucose level of less than 200 mg/dl. There were no differences between these groups with respect to age , sex , procedure , bypass time , antibiotic prophylaxis , or skin preparation methods . Results compared with subcutaneous insulin injections , continuous intravenous insulin infusion induced a significant reduction in perioperative blood glucose levels , which led to a significant reduction in the incidence of deep sternal wound infection in the continuous intravenous insulin infusion group ( 0.8 % [ 12 of 1,499 ] ) versus the intermittent subcutaneous insulin injection group ( 2.0 % [ 19 of 968 ] , p = 0.01 by the chi2 test ) . Multivariate logistic regression revealed that continuous intravenous insulin infusion induced a significant decrease in the risk of deep sternal wound infection ( p = 0.005 ; relative risk , 0.34 ) , whereas obesity ( p < 0.03 ; relative risk , 1.06 ) and use of an internal thoracic artery pedicle ( p = 0.1 ; relative risk , 2.0 ) increased the risk of deep sternal wound infection . Conclusions use of perioperative continuous intravenous insulin infusion in diabetic patients undergoing open heart surgical procedures significantly reduces major infectious morbidity and its associated socioeconomic costs study9: pre‐operative carbohydrate loading may be used in type 2 diabetes patients background : post‐operative insulin resistance and hyperglycaemia are associated with an impaired outcome after surgery . Pre‐operative oral carbohydrate loading ( cho ) reduces post‐operative insulin resistance with a reduced risk of hyperglycaemia during post‐operative nutrition . Insulin‐resistant diabetic patients have not been given cho because the effects on pre‐operative glycaemia and gastric emptying are unknown study10: a carbohydrate-rich drink reduces preoperative discomfort in elective surgery patients we studied the effects of different preoperative oral fluid protocol s on preoperative discomfort , residual gastric fluid volumes , and gastric acidity . Two-hundred-fifty-two elective abdominal surgery patients ( asa physical status i – ii ) were r and omized to preparation with a 12.5 % carbohydrate drink ( cho ) , placebo ( flavored water ) , or overnight fasting . The cho and placebo groups were double-blinded and were given 800 ml to drink on the evening before and 400 ml on the morning of surgery . Visual analog scales were used to score 11 different discomfort variables . Cho did not increase gastric fluid volumes or affect acidity , and there were no adverse events . The visual analog scale scores in a control situation were not different between groups . During the waiting period before surgery , the cho-treated group was less hungry and less anxious than both the other groups ( p ≤ 0.05 ) . Cho reduced thirst as effectively as placebo ( p < 0.0001 versus fasted ) . Trend analysis showed consistently decreasing thirst , hunger , anxiety , malaise , and unfitness in the cho group ( p < 0.05 ) . The placebo group experienced decreasing unfitness and malaise , whereas nausea , tiredness , and inability to concentrate increased ( p < 0.05 ) . In the fasted group , hunger , thirst , tiredness , weakness , and inability to concentrate increased ( p < 0.05 ) . In conclusion , cho significantly reduces preoperative discomfort without adversely affecting gastric contents","Conclusions: preoperative carbohydrate drinks significantly improved insulin resistance and indices of patient comfort following surgery , especially hunger , thirst , malaise , anxiety and nausea . No definite conclusions could be made regarding preservation of muscle mass . Following ingestion of carbohydrate drinks , no adverse events such as apparent or proven aspiration during or after surgery were reported . Administration of oral carbohydrate drinks before surgery is probably safe and may have a positive influence on a wide range of perioperative markers of clinical outcome ."

Your task is to summarize the main conclusions of the studies. Background: and purpose — the safety and efficacy of restarting anticoagulation therapy after intracranial hemorrhage ( ich ) remain unclear . We performed a systematic review and meta- analysis to summarize the associations of anticoagulation resumption with the subsequent risk of ich recurrence and thromboembolism . Study1: long-term outcome after anticoagulation-associated intracerebral haemorrhage with or without restarting antithrombotic therapy background : for patients who survive intracerebral haemorrhage ( ich ) during treatment with oral anticoagulation ( oac ) , the balance between the benefits and risks of restarting oac is unclear . The decision to restart oac or to start antiplatelet therapy in these patients therefore poses a dilemma for all physicians involved . We assessed the long-term outcome of patients who did or did not restart antithrombotic therapy after oac-associated ich . Methods : we conducted a retrospective follow-up study of all patients discharged from our institution after oac-associated ich over a 10-year period . Data on the use of oac or platelet inhibitors and the occurrence of vascular events during follow-up were assessed through question naires and patient files . The primary outcome was recurrent fatal or non-fatal stroke . Secondary outcomes were the occurrence of other haemorrhagic , thrombotic or thromboembolic events . With patients without antithrombotic treatment as reference , we calculated incidence ratios with corresponding 95 % confidence intervals ( ci ) for treatment with oac and for treatment with antiplatelet therapy . Results : we included 38 patients , of whom 21 ( 55 % ) died during a mean follow-up of 3.5 years . The medication regime changed frequently during follow-up , illustrated by the fact that two thirds of the patients who had resumed oac within 2 months of ich terminated this at later points in time . Two recurrent strokes occurred during 35.4 patient-years without antithrombotic medication , 7 during 63.8 patient-years on antiplatelet medication ( incidence ratio 1.9 ; 95 % ci , 0.4 - 9.4 ) , and 3 during 19.5 patient-years on oac ( incidence ratio 2.7 ; 95 % ci , 0.5 - 16.3 ) . There was only 1 recurrent ich , which occurred during treatment with oac . Conclusion : in this observational study , no significant difference in the primary outcome measure was found between the treatment groups , but there was a tendency towards a higher long-term risk of any stroke in patients who resumed oac or started antiplatelet therapy . However , based on these results it is difficult to draw any concrete conclusions or make any strong recommendations . A r and omized trial to assess the optimal long-term strategy after oac-related ich is warranted . Based on the point estimates of our study , such a trial should involve at least 300 patient-years of follow-up study2: reinitiation of anticoagulation after warfarin-associated intracranial hemorrhage and mortality risk: the best practice for reinitiating anticoagulation therapy after intracranial bleeding (brain) study. Background while warfarin-related intracranial hemorrhage ( ich ) occurs in 0.25%-1.1 % patients per year , little is known about the practice and outcomes of anticoagulant reinitiation . Methods we studied a cohort of consecutive patients with warfarin-related ich ( intracerebral or subarachnoid ) admitted to 13 stroke centres in the registry of the canadian stroke network between july 2003 and march 2008 . We examined patterns of warfarin reinitiation and variables associated with 30-day and 1-year outcomes . Results among the 284 patients studied ( mean age 74 ± 12 years ) , warfarin was restarted in-hospital in 91 patients ( 32 % ) . Factors associated with restarting warfarin were lower stroke severity ( adjusted odds ratio [ aor ] 2.07 , 95 % confidence interval [ ci ] ; 1.20 - 3.57 , p = 0.009 ) or presence of valve prosthesis ( aor 3.07 , 95 % ci ; 1.29 - 7.27 , p = 0.011 ) . Mortality rates were not higher in those who restarted warfarin in-hospital : 31.9 % vs 54.4 % ( 30-day , p < 0.001 ) and 48 % vs 61 % ( 1-year , p = 0.04 ) , and bleeding was not increased . Multivariable predictors of mortality included initial international normalized ratio > 3.0 ( aor , 3.28 [ 30-day , p < 0.001 ] and 3.32 [ 1-year , p = 0.003 ] ) , greater stroke severity ( aor , 6.04 [ 30-day ] and 4.22 [ 1-year ] ; both p < 0.001 ) , and intraventricular hemorrhage ( aor , 2.19 [ 30-day ; p = 0.03 ] and 2.04 [ 1-year ; p = 0.04 ] ) . In selected patients who reinitiated warfarin , there was no increase in 30-day ( aor , 0.49 ; p = 0.03 ) or 1-year mortality ( aor , 0.79 ; p = 0.43 ) . Conclusions in selected patients at high thrombosis risk , reinitiation of warfarin after ich did not confer increased mortality or bleeding events study3: low-dose intravenous heparin infusion in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: a preliminary assessment. Object aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage ( asah ) predisposes to delayed neurological deficits , including stroke and cognitive and neuropsychological abnormalities . Heparin is a pleiotropic drug that antagonizes many of the pathophysiological mechanisms implicated in secondary brain injury after asah . Methods the authors performed a retrospective analysis in 86 consecutive patients with fisher grade 3 asah due to rupture of a supratentorial aneurysm who presented within 36 hours and were treated by surgical clipping within 48 hours of their ictus . Forty-three patients were managed postoperatively with a low-dose intravenous heparin infusion ( maryl and low-dose intravenous heparin infusion protocol : 8 u/kg/hr progressing over 36 hours to 10 u/kg/hr ) beginning 12 hours after surgery and continuing until day 14 after the ictus . Forty-three control patients received conventional subcutaneous heparin twice daily as deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis . Results patients in the 2 groups were balanced in terms of baseline characteristics . In the heparin group , activated partial thromboplastin times were normal to mildly elevated ; no clinical ly significant hemorrhages or instances of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia or deep vein thrombosis were encountered . In the control group , the incidence of clinical vasospasm requiring rescue therapy ( induced hypertension , selective intraarterial verapamil , and angioplasty ) was 20 ( 47 % ) of 43 patients , and 9 ( 21 % ) of 43 patients experienced a delayed infa rct on ct scanning . In the heparin group , the incidence of clinical vasospasm requiring rescue therapy was 9 % ( 4 of 43 , p = 0.0002 ) , and no patient suffered a delayed infa rct ( p = 0.003 ) . Conclusions in patients with fisher grade 3 asah whose aneurysm is secured , postprocedure use of a low-dose intravenous heparin infusion may be safe and beneficial study4: anticoagulant reversal, blood pressure levels, and anticoagulant resumption in patients with anticoagulation-related intracerebral hemorrhage. Importance although use of oral anticoagulants ( oacs ) is increasing , there is a substantial lack of data on how to treat oac-associated intracerebral hemorrhage ( ich ) . Objective to assess the association of anticoagulation reversal and blood pressure ( bp ) with hematoma enlargement and the effects of oac resumption . Design , setting , and participants retrospective cohort study at 19 german tertiary care centers ( 2006 - 2012 ) including 1176 individuals for analysis of long-term functional outcome , 853 for analysis of hematoma enlargement , and 719 for analysis of oac resumption . Exposures reversal of anticoagulation during acute phase , systolic bp at 4 hours , and reinitiation of oac for long-term treatment . Main outcomes and measures frequency of hematoma enlargement in relation to international normalized ratio ( inr ) and bp . Incidence analysis of ischemic and hemorrhagic events with or without oac resumption . Factors associated with favorable ( modified rankin scale score , 0 - 3 ) vs unfavorable functional outcome . Results hemorrhage enlargement occurred in 307 of 853 patients ( 36.0 % ) . Reduced rates of hematoma enlargement were associated with reversal of inr levels < 1.3 within 4 hours after admission ( 43/217 [ 19.8 % ] ) vs inr of ≥1.3 ( 264/636 [ 41.5 % ] ; p < .001 ) and systolic bp < 160 mm hg at 4 hours ( 167/504 [ 33.1 % ] ) vs ≥160 mm hg ( 98/187 [ 52.4 % ] ; p < .001 ) . The combination of inr reversal < 1.3 within 4 hours and systolic bp of < 160 mm hg at 4 hours was associated with lower rates of hematoma enlargement ( 35/193 [ 18.1 % ] vs 220/498 [ 44.2 % ] not achieving these values ; or , 0.28 ; 95 % ci , 0.19 - 0.42 ; p < .001 ) and lower rates of in-hospital mortality ( 26/193 [ 13.5 % ] vs 103/498 [ 20.7 % ] ; or , 0.60 ; 95 % ci , 0.37 - 0.95 ; p = .03 ) . Oac was resumed in 172 of 719 survivors ( 23.9 % ) . Oac resumption showed fewer ischemic complications ( oac : 9/172 [ 5.2 % ] vs no oac : 82/547 [ 15.0 % ] ; p < .001 ) and not significantly different hemorrhagic complications ( oac : 14/172 [ 8.1 % ] vs no oac : 36/547 [ 6.6 % ] ; p = .48 ) . Propensity-matched survival analysis in patients with atrial fibrillation who restarted oac showed a decreased hr of 0.258 ( 95 % ci , 0.125 - 0.534 ; p < .001 ) for long-term mortality . Functional long-term outcome was unfavorable in 786 of 1083 patients ( 72.6 % ) . Conclusions and relevance among patients with oac-associated ich , reversal of inr < 1.3 within 4 hours and systolic bp < 160 mm hg at 4 hours were associated with lower rates of hematoma enlargement , and resumption of oac therapy was associated with lower risk of ischemic events . These findings require replication and assessment in prospect i ve studies . Trial registration clinical trials.Gov identifier : nct01829581","Conclusions: — in observational studies , reinstitution of anticoagulation after ich was associated with a lower risk of thromboembolic complications and a similar risk of ich recurrence ."

Based on its mechanism of action , varenicline seemed to be a likely c and i date for treating alcohol dependence . Methods alcohol dependent subjects ( n=40 ) were enrolled in a 13-week double-blind placebo controlled clinical trial . Subject visits were once per week . At each visit , subjects were tested for breath alcohol levels , provided self-report data on alcohol and nicotine use , and on mood and craving . In addition , subjects received once a week medical management ( mm ) . Results there was no difference between varenicline and placebo treated groups on any of the drinking outcomes . Compared to placebo-treated subjects , varenicline treated subjects had decreased rates of alcohol craving and cigarette smoking , as well as greater mood improvements during the later part of the study ( weeks 6 - 13 ) . In addition , among subjects who were cigarette smokers , those treated with varenicline were significantly less likely to report heavy drinking during the trial . Conclusions although varenicline was not significantly more effective than placebo at reducing drinking during the trial , its effects on alcohol craving and mood suggest that future investigation of the mechanism of action of varenicline , as well as additional clinical studies may be warranted . In particular , the findings regarding the influence of smoking status on heavy drinking among varenicline-treated subjects should be investigated in future studies study2: a pilot study of the efficacy of varenicline for the treatment of smokeless tobacco users in midwestern united states. Introduction long-term smokeless tobacco ( st ) use is known to increase the risk for oropharyngeal cancer , heart attack , and stroke . Varenicline has recently been demonstrated to increase st abstinence rates among swedish snus users . We have conducted a pilot study to obtain preliminary evidence of efficacy of varenicline for the treatment of st users in midwestern united states . Methods we conducted a r and omized , placebo-controlled phase ii clinical trial to evaluate the potential efficacy of 12 weeks of varenicline for the treatment of st users with an a priori decision rule that a 1-tailed p < .20 for the comparison of the primary endpoint was evidence to conclude that future studies were warranted . Subjects were followed for 6 months after r and omization . Results we r and omized 76 subjects ( 38 varenicline and 38 placebo ) . Subjects were similar at baseline with a mean age of 41 years , and all were male . The biochemically confirmed point prevalence tobacco abstinence rates at end of treatment were 55.3 % for varenicline and 42.1 % for placebo ( p = .126 ) and 47.4 % and 31.6 % ( p = .080 ) , respectively , at 6 months . Point prevalence st abstinence rates at end of treatment for varenicline were 57.9 % and 42.1 % for placebo ( p = .084 ) and 57.9 % and 31.6 % ( p = .011 ) , respectively , at 6 months . Varenicline was associated with significantly less craving compared with placebo . Varenicline was well tolerated with nausea and sleep disturbance being the most common side effects . Conclusions varenicline decreases craving and may be effective for increasing tobacco abstinence rates among st users . Larger trials may be warranted to confirm these results study3: smoking cessation with varenicline, a selective alpha4beta2 nicotinic receptor partial agonist: results from a 7-week, randomized, placebo- and bupropion-controlled trial with 1-year follow-up. Background currently available smoking cessation therapies have limited success rates . Varenicline tartrate is a novel , selective nicotinic receptor partial agonist developed specifically for smoking cessation . This study evaluated the efficacy , tolerability , and safety of 3 varenicline doses for smoking cessation . Bupropion hydrochloride was included as an active control . Methods a phase 2 , multicenter , r and omized , double-blind , placebo-controlled study of healthy smokers ( 18 - 65 years old ) . Subjects were r and omized to varenicline tartrate , 0.3 mg once daily ( n = 128 ) , 1.0 mg once daily ( n = 128 ) , or 1.0 mg twice daily ( n = 127 ) , for 6 weeks plus placebo for 1 week ; to 150-mg sustained-release bupropion hydrochloride twice daily ( n = 128 ) for 7 weeks ; or to placebo ( n = 127 ) for 7 weeks . Results during the treatment phase , the continuous quit rates for any 4 weeks were significantly higher for varenicline tartrate , 1.0 mg twice daily ( 48.0 % ; p<.001 ) and 1.0 mg once daily ( 37.3 % ; p<.001 ) , than for placebo ( 17.1 % ) . The bupropion rate was 33.3 % ( p = .002 vs placebo ) . The carbon monoxide-confirmed continuous quit rates from week 4 to week 52 were significantly higher in the varenicline tartrate , 1.0 mg twice daily , group compared with the placebo group ( 14.4 % vs 4.9 % ; p = .002 ) . The bupropion rate was 6.3 % ( p = .60 vs placebo ) . Discontinuation owing to treatment-emergent adverse events was 15.9 % for bupropion , 11.2 % to 14.3 % for varenicline , and 9.8 % for placebo . No dose-related increases occurred in adverse events for varenicline . Conclusions varenicline tartrate demonstrated both short-term ( 1 mg twice daily and 1 mg once daily ) and long-term efficacy ( 1 mg twice daily ) vs placebo . Varenicline was well tolerated and may provide a novel therapy to aid smoking cessation study4: effects of varenicline on smoking cessation in patients with mild to moderate copd: a randomized controlled trial. Background smoking is the most important risk factor for copd and accelerates its progression . Despite the health implication s , a large proportion of patients with copd continue to smoke , so finding effective smoking cessation interventions for this population is paramount . To our knowledge , this is the first r and omized clinical trial to compare the efficacy and safety of varenicline tartrate vs placebo in smokers with mild to moderate copd . Methods in a 27-center , double-blind , multinational study , 504 patients with mild to moderate copd ( postbronchodilator fev1/fvc , < 70 % ; fev1 percent predicted normal value , ≥50 % ) and without known psychiatric disturbances were r and omized to receive varenicline ( n=250 ) or placebo ( n=254 ) for 12 weeks , with a 40-week nontreatment follow-up . The primary end point was carbon monoxide-confirmed continuous abstinence rate ( car ) for weeks 9 to 12 . A secondary end point was car for weeks 9 to 52 . Results car for weeks 9 to 12 was significantly higher for patients in the varenicline group ( 42.3 % ) than for those in the placebo group ( 8.8 % ) ( or , 8.40 ; 95 % ci , 4.99 - 14.14 ; p<.0001 ) . Car in the patients treated with varenicline remained significantly higher than in those treated with placebo through weeks 9 to 52 ( 18.6 % vs 5.6 % ) ( or , 4.04 ; 95 % ci , 2.13 - 7.67 ; p<.0001 ) . Nausea , abnormal dreams , upper-respiratory tract infection , and insomnia were the most commonly reported adverse events ( aes ) for patients in the varenicline group . Serious aes were infrequent in both treatment groups . Two patients in the varenicline group and one patient in the placebo group died during the study . Reports of psychiatric aes were similar for both treatment groups . Conclusions varenicline was more efficacious than placebo for smoking cessation in patients with mild to moderate copd and demonstrated a safety profile consistent with that observed in previous trials .

Clinical trials.Gov study5: a randomized placebo-controlled trial of varenicline for smoking cessation allowing flexible quit dates introduction : current smoking cessation guidelines recommend setting a quit date prior to starting pharmacotherapy . However , providing flexibility in the date of quitting may be more acceptable to some smokers . The objective of this study was to compare varenicline 1 mg twice daily ( b.I.D . ) with placebo in subjects using a flexible quit date paradigm after starting medication . Methods : in this double-blind , r and omized , placebo-controlled international study , smokers of ≥10 cigarettes/day , aged 18–75 years , and who were motivated to quit were r and omized ( 3:1 ) to receive varenicline 1 mg b.I.D . Or placebo for 12 weeks . Subjects were followed up through week 24 . Subjects were instructed to quit between days 8 and 35 after starting medication . The primary endpoint was carbon monoxide – confirmed continuous abstinence during weeks 9–12 , and a key secondary endpoint was continuous abstinence during weeks 9–24 . Results : overall , 493 subjects were r and omized to varenicline and 166 to placebo . Continuous abstinence was higher for varenicline than for placebo subjects at the end of treatment ( weeks 9–12 : 53.1 % vs. 19.3 % ; odds ratio [ or ] 5.9 ; 95 % ci , 3.7–9.4 ; p < .0001 ) and through 24 weeks follow-up ( weeks 9–24 : 34.7 % vs. 12.7 % ; or 4.4 ; 95 % ci , 2.6–7.5 ; p < .0001 ) . Serious adverse events occurred in 1.2 % varenicline ( none were psychiatric ) and 0.6 % placebo subjects . Fewer varenicline than placebo subjects reported depression-related adverse events ( 2.3 % vs. 6.7 % , respectively ) . Conclusions : varenicline 1 mg b.I.D . Using a flexible quit date paradigm had similar efficacy and safety compared with previous fixed quit date studies study6: effects of moderate-dose treatment with varenicline on neurobiological and cognitive biomarkers in smokers and nonsmokers with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Context the administration of nicotine transiently improves many neurobiological and cognitive functions in schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder . It is not yet clear which nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ( nachr ) subtype or subtypes are responsible for these seemingly pervasive nicotinic effects in schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder . Objective because α4β2 is a key nachr subtype for nicotinic actions , we investigated the effect of varenicline tartrate , a relatively specific α4β2 partial agonist and antagonist , on key biomarkers that are associated with schizophrenia and are previously shown to be responsive to nicotinic challenge in humans . Design a double-blind , parallel , r and omized , placebo-controlled trial of patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder to examine the effects of varenicline on biomarkers at 2 weeks ( short-term treatment ) and 8 weeks ( long-term treatment ) , using a slow titration and moderate dosing strategy for retaining α4β2-specific effects while minimizing adverse effects . Setting outpatient clinics . Participants a total of 69 smoking and nonsmoking patients ; 64 patients completed week 2 , and 59 patients completed week 8 . Intervention varenicline . Main outcome measures prepulse inhibition , sensory gating , antisaccade , spatial working memory , eye tracking , processing speed , and sustained attention . Results a moderate dose of varenicline ( 1 ) significantly reduced the p50 sensory gating deficit in nonsmokers after long-term treatment ( p = .006 ) , ( 2 ) reduced startle reactivity ( p = .02 ) regardless of baseline smoking status , and ( 3 ) improved executive function by reducing the antisaccadic error rate ( p = .03 ) regardless of smoking status . A moderate dose of varenicline had no significant effect on spatial working memory , predictive and maintenance pursuit measures , processing speed , or sustained attention by conners ' continuous performance test . Clinical ly , there was no evidence of exacerbation of psychiatric symptoms , psychosis , depression , or suicidality using a gradual titration ( 1-mg daily dose ) . Conclusions moderate-dose treatment with varenicline has a unique treatment profile on core schizophrenia-related biomarkers . Further development is warranted for specific nachr compounds and dosing and duration strategies to target subgroups of schizophrenic patients with specific biological deficits study7: the efficacy and safety of varenicline for smoking cessation using a flexible dosing strategy in adult smokers: a randomized controlled trial. Objective to determine whether self-regulated flexible dosing with varenicline tartrate is safe and effective for smoking cessation . Research design and methods 320 healthy , motivated-to-quit smokers ( > or = 10 cigarettes/day ) aged 18 - 65 years , entered a multicenter , r and omized , double-blind , placebo-controlled study - conducted between december 26 , 2001 and june 24 , 2003 - with a 12-week treatment phase and 40-week , double-blind , non-treatment follow-up . Treatment consisted of varenicline or placebo in fixed doses ( week 1 : titrated from 0.5 to 1.0 mg/day ) followed by a self-regulated flexible schedule ( weeks 2 - 12 : 0.5 - 2.0 mg/day ) . Main outcome measures primary outcomes included carbon monoxide-confirmed continuous abstinence rate ( car ) from smoking for weeks 4 through 7 , 9 through 12 , and 9 through 52 . Secondary outcomes included car from weeks 9 through 24 , 7-day point prevalence of abstinence , safety assessment s , and measures of craving , withdrawal , and smoking reward . Results superior cars were observed in varenicline-treated ( n = 157 ) versus placebo participants ( n=155 ) for weeks 4 through 7 ( 38.2 vs. 11.6 % ) , 9 through 12 ( 40.1 vs. 11.6 % ) , 9 through 24 ( 28.0 vs. 9.0 % ) , and 9 through 52 ( 22.3 vs. 7.7 % ) ( all p<0.001 ) . Seven-day point prevalence was higher in varenicline-treated than placebo participants at weeks 12 ( 46.5 vs. 14.2 % ; p<0.001 ) , 24 ( 32.5 vs. 13.5 % ; p<0.001 ) , and 52 ( 28.0 vs. 13.5 % ; p=0.001 ) . Overall , medication compliance was high , although varenicline-treated , but not placebo , participants tended to taper down their dosage over time . Total treatment-emergent aes were 77.1 % ( varenicline : 121/157 ) and 65.8 % ( placebo : 102/155 ) . Few aes led to treatment discontinuation ( varenicline : 11/157 , 7.0 % and placebo : 7/155 , 4.5 % ) . Participants were primarily healthy caucasians , so more research is necessary to determine how applicable these findings are to other population s. Conclusions a self-regulated , flexible dosing regimen of varenicline is well tolerated , with superior effectiveness versus placebo for smoking cessation study8: varenicline for smoking cessation in bipolar disorder: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Objective virtually no clinical trials for smoking cessation have been undertaken in bipolar disorder . Varenicline has shown efficacy for smoking cessation , but warnings about neuropsychiatric adverse events have been issued . We assessed the efficacy and safety of varenicline in euthymic bipolar subjects motivated to quit smoking . Method clinical ly stable adult patients with dsm-iv bipolar disorder ( n = 60 ) who smoked ≥ 10 cigarettes per day were r and omized to a 3-month , double-blind , placebo-controlled varenicline trial and a 3-month follow-up . Study enrollment was completed from february 2010 through march 2013 . Varenicline was dosed using st and ard titration , and smoking cessation counseling was provided to all patients . The primary outcome was defined as a 7-day point prevalence of self-reported no smoking verified by expired carbon monoxide level < 10 ppm at 12 weeks . Psychopathology and side-effects were assessed at each visit . Results at 3 months ( end of treatment ) , significantly more subjects quit smoking with varenicline ( n/n = 15/31 , 48.4 % ) than with placebo ( n/n = 3/29 , 10.3 % ) ( or = 8.1 ; 95 % ci , 2.03 - 32.5 ; p < .002 ) . At 6 months , 6 of 31 varenicline-treated subjects ( 19.4 % ) remained abstinent compared to 2 of 29 ( 6.90 % ) assigned to placebo ( or = 3.2 ; 95 % ci , 0.60 - 17.6 ; p = .17 ) . Psychopathology scores remained stable . Ten serious adverse events occurred ( n = 6 , varenicline ; n = 4 , placebo ) . Abnormal dreams occurred significantly more often in varenicline-treated subjects ( n/n = 18/31 , 61.3 % ) than in those receiving placebo ( n/n = 9/29 , 31 % ; fisher exact test , p = .04 ) . Eight varenicline-treated and 5 placebo-assigned subjects expressed fleeting suicidal ideation , a nonsignificant difference . Conclusions varenicline shows efficacy for initiating smoking cessation in bipolar patients , but medication trials of longer duration are warranted for maintaining abstinence . Vigilance for neuropsychiatric adverse events is prudent when initiating varenicline for smoking cessation in this patient population . Trial registration clinical trials.Gov identifier : nct01010204 study9: efficacy of varenicline to prompt quit attempts in smokers not currently trying to quit: a randomized placebo-controlled trial. Introduction nicotine replacement therapy to aid smoking reduction increases the probability of a future quit attempt among smokers not currently planning to quit smoking . We tested whether varenicline , a partial nicotine agonist , would also increase future quit attempts . Methods this r and omized , placebo-controlled trial recruited 218 smokers who were interested in quitting but had no plans to quit in the next month . Participants used varenicline ( 2 mg/day ) or placebo for 2 - 8 weeks plus received brief counseling on methods to reduce cigarettes/day . The primary measure was the incidence of a quit attempt within 6 months of study entry . Secondary measures were point prevalence abstinence , motivation to stop smoking , and reduction in cigarettes/day . Results varenicline increased the incidence of a quit attempt more than placebo at the nebraska site ( 73 % vs. 41 % ; p < .001 ) but not at the vermont site ( 45 % vs. 51 % ; p = .45 ) . Varenicline increased most other measures of quit attempts , motivation and abstinence , independent of site . The beneficial effects of varenicline in quit attempts appeared to be mediated by greater reductions in cigarettes/day , dependence , craving , and cigarette satisfaction . Varenicline had a greater effect on quit attempts in less-dependent smokers , in minority smokers , and in those who had less prior cessation or reduction activity . Adverse events were minimal . Conclusions varenicline increased quit attempts in smokers who are not currently trying to quit at one of the two study sites and improved most all secondary outcomes independent of site . This appeared to be due to decreasing cigarettes/day and level of dependence study10: pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability following multiple oral doses of varenicline under various titration schedules in elderly nonsmokers. This study was design ed to investigate the multiple-dose pharmacokinetics , safety , and tolerability of the selective α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine partial agonist , varenicline , in elderly ( 65 - 85 years old ) nonsmokers . Fifty male and female subjects with normal renal function for their age were r and omized to receive varenicline or placebo once or twice daily for 3 weeks in an investigator- and subject-blinded parallel-group design . Treatment regimens included weekly titration ( n = 14 ; days 1 - 7 , 0.5 mg once daily ; days 8 - 14 , 0.5 mg twice daily ; days 15 - 21 , 1 mg twice daily ) ; 2-week twice-daily titration ( n = 13 ; days 1 - 14 , 0.5 mg once daily ; days 15 - 21 , 0.5 mg twice daily ) ; 2-week once-daily titration ( n = 13 ; days 1 - 14 , 0.5 mg once daily ; days 15 - 21 , 1 mg once daily ) ; and placebo ( n = 10 ) . Approximate dose-proportional increases in systemic exposure of varenicline at steady state , based on maximum concentration and area under the plasma concentration-time curve over the 24-hour period at steady state , were observed across the dose range of 0.5 to 2 mg/d . Median time to maximum concentration was 3 hours . Mean elimination half-life was estimated to be approximately 24 to 32 hours and independent of dose . Varenicline was considered to be safe and well tolerated in this elderly nonsmoking population","Conclusions: this meta- analysis found no evidence of an increased risk of suicide or attempted suicide , suicidal ideation , depression , or death with varenicline . These findings provide some reassurance for users and prescribers regarding the neuropsychiatric safety of varenicline . There was evidence that varenicline was associated with a higher risk of sleep problems such as insomnia and abnormal dreams ."
Text Summarization,English,"You are an expert medical assistant named Aloe, developed by the High Performance Artificial Intelligence Group at Barcelona Supercomputing Center(BSC). You are to be a helpful, respectful, and honest assistant.","You will be given a background statement and some study titles and abstracts. Your task is to summarize the main conclusions of the studies. Background: objective the purpose of this systematic review was to compare the survival and complication rates of all-ceramic restorations after a minimum follow-up time of 5 years . Study1: five-year follow-up with procera all-ceramic crowns. Objective the purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical performance of procera allceram crowns placed over a 5-year period at three different private dental practice s. Method and material s two hundred five procera allceram crowns ( 50 anterior and 155 posterior ) were evaluated in a prospect i ve study from a minimum of 6 months to a maximum of 60 months , with a mean of 23.52 months . Results a restoration was considered to be a failure when it impaired esthetic quality or function , thus necessitating remake of the crown . The survival rate was determined with the use of the kaplan-meier survival rate , which gave an overall survival rate of 96.7 % ( 100 % for the anterior crowns and 95.15 % for the posterior crowns ) . Conclusion the procera allceram system seems to have a good prognosis for the posterior teeth and an excellent one for the anterior teeth study2: prospective clinical split-mouth study of pressed and cad/cam all-ceramic partial-coverage restorations: 7-year results. The aim of this prospect i ve clinical split-mouth study was to investigate the longterm performance of pressed and computer-aided design /computer-assisted manufacture ( cad/cam ) all-ceramic partial-coverage restorations ( pcrs ) . Twentyfive patients were restored with 40 lithium disilicate pressed pcrs ( ips e.Max-press , ivoclar vivadent ) and 40 leucite-reinforced glass-ceramic cad/cam pcrs ( procad , ivoclar vivadent ) . All restorations were placed in vital first or second molars . The 7-year kaplan-meier survival rate was 100 % for pressed pcrs and 97 % for cad/ cam pcrs . Both systems showed significant deterioration over time in all modified united states public health service criteria . Increased surface roughness and impaired color match were significantly more prevalent with pressed pcrs . Based on the 7-year data , both all-ceramic systems can be considered reliable treatment options for posterior pcrs study3: five-year clinical prospective evaluation of zirconia-based denzir 3-unit fpds. Purpose the aim of this prospect i ve study was to evaluate the clinical performance of fully sintered hot isostatic pressed yttria-partially-stabilized zirconia ( denzir ) 3-unit fixed partial dentures ( fpds ) . Material s and methods nineteen 3-unit fpds were placed in 18 patients . Ten fpds were placed in the maxilla and 9 in the m and ible . Two calibrated examiners evaluated the fpds independently 1 week ( baseline ) , 1 year , 3 years , and 5 years after placement using the california dental association quality evaluation system . Results all fpds were intact at the 5-year examination . One fpd lost retention after 12 months but remained intact ; it was recemented and is still in function after 5 years . All fpds were rated satisfactory over 5 years . No changes were seen in terms of color and anatomic form . The number of slightly rough or pitted occlusal surfaces increased approximately 30 % over 5 years . Visible evidence of ditching along the margin increased over time , but only for those fpds luted with zinc phosphate cement . Conclusion the 5-year results indicate that yttria-partially-stabilized zirconia 3-unit fpds with anatomically design ed frameworks are promising prosthetic alternatives , even in the premolar and molar regions . However , for all-ceramic fpds with more units in function , further studies are necessary study4: ten-year outcome of three-unit fixed dental prostheses made from monolithic lithium disilicate ceramic. Background the authors conducted a prospect i ve study to evaluate the long-term outcome of crown-retained fixed dental prostheses ( fdps ) made from monolithic lithium disilicate ceramic ( ips e.Max press , ivoclar vivadent , schaan , liechtenstein ) . Methods faculty dentists at the department of prosthodontics , propaedeutics and dental material s , school of dentistry , christian-albrechts university at kiel , germany , placed 36 three-unit fdps in 28 patients to replace six anterior and 30 posterior teeth . The proximal connector size ( height and width ) was 4 × 3 millimeters for anterior fdps and 4 × 4 mm for posterior fdps . Fdps were cemented either conventionally with glass ionomer cement ( n = 19 ) or adhesively with resin-based composite ( n = 17 ) . Patients made annual recall visits . Results the mean ( st and ard deviation ) observation period was 121 ( 12.8 ) months . Fdps ' survival rate ( survival being defined as remaining in place either with or without complications ) was 100 percent after five years and 87.9 percent after 10 years , and their success rate ( success being defined as remaining unchanged and free of complications ) was 91.1 percent after five years and 69.8 percent after 10 years . The cementation method did not affect the outcome . Conclusion three-unit fdps made from monolithic lithium disilicate ceramic showed five- and 10-year survival and success rates that were similar to those of conventional metal-ceramic fdps . Clinical implication s if the manufacturer 's recommendations are followed , three-unit fdps made from monolithic lithium disilicate ceramic may be a safe alternative to metal-ceramic fdps regardless of the cementation method used study5: clinical outcome of three-unit lithium-disilicate glass-ceramic fixed dental prostheses: up to 8 years results. Objectives the purpose of this prospect i ve study was to evaluate the clinical outcome of crown-retained fixed dental prostheses ( fdps ) made from a lithium-disilicate glass-ceramic ( ips e.Max press , ivoclar-vivadent ) . Methods thirty-six three-unit fdps were placed in 28 patients . The fdps replaced teeth in the anterior ( 16 % ) and posterior ( 84 % ) regions . All teeth were prepared following a st and ardized protocol . The size of the proximal connector of the fdps was 12 mm2 ( anterior ) or 16 mm2 ( posterior ) . Fdps were cemented either with glass-ionomer cement ( n=19 ) or composite resin ( n=17 ) . The following parameters were evaluated at baseline , 6 months after cementation and then annually ( at abutment and contralateral teeth ) : probing pocket depth , plaque index , bleeding on probing , and tooth vitality . Results three fdps were defined as drop-out . The mean observation period of the remaining 33 fdps was 86 months ( range : 67 - 98 months ) : two fdps in two patients had to be replaced ( 6 % ) because of fractures . The 8-year survival rate according to kaplan-meier was 93 % . In addition , chipping of the veneering material was found in two fdps ( 6 % ) . Two abutments ( 3 % ) of two restorations had to be treated endodontically ; and two fdps ( 6 % ) lost retention and had to be recemented . These complications did not affect the function of the involved restorations clinical ly . There were no significant differences between the periodontal parameters of the test and control teeth . Significance short-span crown-retained three-unit fdps made from lithium-disilicate glass-ceramic can be used clinical ly irrespective of an adhesive or conventional cementation study6: prospective clinical study of press-ceramic overlap and full veneer restorations: 7-year results. The aim of this prospect i ve clinical study was to investigate the long-term performance of all-ceramic veneers with overlap ( ov ) and full veneer ( fv ) preparation design s. Twenty-five patients were restored using 42 ov restorations ( incisal/palatal butt-joint margin ) and 24 fv restorations ( palatal rounded shoulder margin ) . All restorations were leucite-reinforced glass-ceramic anterior veneers . The 7-year kaplan-meier survival rate was 100 % for fv restorations and 97.6 % for ov restorations . The all-ceramic veneers revealed significant deterioration over time according to united states public health service criteria , irrespective of the preparation design . Based on the 7-year results of this study , both preparation design s can be considered reliable treatment options for anterior teeth with extended deficits study7: survival rates of ips empress 2 all-ceramic crowns and fixed partial dentures: results of a 5-year prospective clinical study. Objective the aim of this prospect i ve clinical study was to evaluate the survival rates of ips empress 2 ( ivoclar vivadent ) all-ceramic crowns and fixed partial dentures ( fpds ) after an observation period of up to 5 years . Method and material s forty-three patients ( 19 women and 24 men ) were included in this study . The patients were treated with a total of 58 adhesive bonded ips empress 2 restorations . A total of 27 single crowns were placed on molars and premolars , and 31 three-unit fpds were placed in the anterior and premolar regions . Clinical follow-up examinations took place at 6 , 12 , 24 , 36 , 48 , and 60 months after insertion . Statistical analysis of the data was calculated using the kaplan-meier method . Results results of the 50-month analysis ( interquartile range , 33 to 61 months ) showed that the survival rate was 100 % for crowns and 70 % for fpds . Six failures that occurred exclusively in the three-unit fpds were observed . Framework fractures were recorded in three fpd units where the connector dimensions did not meet the manufacturer specifications . Only one fpd exhibited an irreparable partial veneer fracture , and 2 fpds showed evidence of biologic failures . The accuracy of fit and esthetic parameters were clinical ly satisfactory for crowns and fpds . Conclusion the results of this 5-year clinical evaluation suggest that ips empress 2 ceramic is an appropriate material for the fabrication of single crowns . Because of the reduced survival rates , strict conditions should be considered before the use of ips empress 2 material for the fabrication of three-unit fpds study8: clinical performance of long-span zirconia frameworks for fixed dental prostheses: 5-year results. The purpose of this prospect i ve cohort study was to assess the performance of tooth-supported , long-span , zirconia fixed dental prostheses ( fdps ) . Thirty fdps with span lengths from 36 to 46 mm ( mean 40·33 mm ) , with 4 - 7 units and with connector dimensions ∼9 mm(2 ) were inserted ( 19 in the posterior region , 11 including anterior teeth ) using glass-ionomer cement . The performance of the fdps was assessed ( aesthetic evaluation , failures , hypersensitivity/tooth vitality , secondary caries , pocket depth , decementation , and chipping ) at baseline and after 5 years . Cox regression analysis was performed to identify risk factors . There were 16 failures after 5 years . Framework fracture occurred for two fdps , four fdps had to be re-cemented , one abutment tooth had to be treated endodontically , one abutment tooth fractured and cohesive failure of the veneer occurred for eight . Four fdps had to be replaced , so survival was 82 % . The aesthetics were rated as excellent by the patients at baseline and good at the 5-year recall . Cox regression analysis showed that both length [ p = 0·05 , exp(b ) = 1·22 ] and location [ p = 0·019 , exp(b ) = 4·09 ] of the fdp were risk factors for failure . Compared with the previously published 2-year results , the incidence of complications increased dramatically . Additionally , it was shown that long-span fdps in the molar region are at greater risk of failure than fdps in the anterior region study9: long-term performance of posterior inceram alumina crowns cemented with different luting agents: a prospective, randomized clinical split-mouth study over 5 years objectives this prospect i ve , r and omized clinical split-mouth study investigated the 5-year performance of inceram alumina posterior crowns cemented with three different luting cements . 4-meta- and mdp-based cements were used for adhesive luting . Glass ionomer cement served as control . Material s and methods sixty patients were treated with 149 ( n = 62 panavia f/mdp ; n = 59 superbond-c&b/4-meta ; n = 28 ketac cem/glass ionomer ) inceram alumina crowns on vital molars and premolars in a comparable position . Follow-up examinations were performed annually up to 5 years after crown placement using the modified united states public health service ( usphs ) criteria . Kaplan – meier survival analysis comprised secondary caries , clinical ly unacceptable fractures , root canal treatment and debonding . Kaplan – meier success rate included restorations with minimal crevices , tolerable color deviations ( < 1 vitashade ) , and clinical ly acceptable fractures . Logistic regression models with a r and om intercept were fitted . Results the 5-year kaplan – meier survival probabilities were : superbond-c&b 88.7 % , panavia f 82.8 % , ketac cem 80.1 % with no significant difference ( p = .813 ) . Endodontical treatment was carried out on 7.4 % of all abutment teeth , and 5.4 % revealed secondary caries . Unacceptable ceramic fractures were observed in 7.4 % . Debonding was a rare complication ( 1.3 % ) . The 5 year kaplan – meier success rate was 91.6 % for superbond-c&b- , 87.4 % for ketac cem- and 86.3 % for panavia f-bonded restorations with no significant difference ( p = .624 ) . All cement types showed significant marginal deterioration over time ( p < .0001 ) . Conclusions posterior inceram alumina crowns showed acceptable long-term survival and success rates independent of luting agent used . Ceramic fractures , endodontical treatments and secondary caries were the most frequent failures . Clinical relevance glass-infiltrated alumina crowns in combination with adhesive as well as conventional cementation can be considered as a reliable treatment option in posterior teeth study10: a prospective 15-year evaluation of extensive dentin-enamel-bonded pressed ceramic coverages. Objectives the purpose of this study was to investigate the durability of extensive dentin-enamel-bonded posterior ceramic coverages in a 15 years follow-up . Methods all extensive dentin-enamel-bonded posterior partial and complete all-ceramic coverages placed during the period november 1992-december 1998 were included . In 121 patients , 252 coverages ( ips empress ) were placed . The adhesive bonding to dentin and enamel was performed with three 3-step and one 2-step etch and rinse bonding . In 106 restorations the classic syntac was used in combination with the dual-cured resin composite variolink . The other restorations were luted with the chemically cured resin composite bisfil 2b and bonded with 3-step etch and rinse systems , classic gluma ( 37 ) , allbond 2 ( 57 ) , syntac ( 32 ) or the 2-step etch and rinse system , one step ( 20 ) . The ceramics were evaluated yearly by modified usphs criteria during 15 years . Results postoperative sensitivity was registered in 4 patients during bite forces lasting for 2 - 4 weeks . Fifty-five of 228 coverages ( 24.1 % ) failed . The mean observation period of the acceptable coverages was 12.6 years ( range 11 - 15 years ) . The main reasons for failure were lost restorations ( 18 ) , ceramic fracture ( 16 ) , and secondary caries ( 11 ) . Significant differences in failure rate were observed between the dentin bonding agents but not between the two luting agents . Ceramic coverages placed on non-vital teeth failed in 39 % and on vital teeth in 20.9 % ( p=0.014 ) . Logistic regression indicated three significant predictors for failure of the coverages : gender and parafunctional habits of the patient and non-vitality of the tooth . Significance the technique investigated showed advantages like less destruction of healthy tissue , and avoiding of endodontic treatment and /or deep cervical placement of restoration margins to obtain retention","Conclusions: overall , the 5-year complication rates were low . The most frequent complications were secondary caries , endodontic problems , ceramic fractures , ceramic chipping , and loss of retention . Conclusion this systematic review showed that all-ceramic restorations fabricated using the correct clinical protocol have an adequate clinical survival for at least 5 years of clinical service with very low complication rates . Minor ceramic chipping and debonding did not affect the longevity of the restorations . Clinical relevance long-term clinical performance of all-ceramic restorations manufactured using various ceramic systems provides clinical evidence of complications and long-term management of these restorations . Available evidence indicates the effectiveness of many ceramic systems for numerous clinical applications . Correct planning and a rigorous technical execution protocol increase clinical success . Studies of ceramic prostheses indicate more problems with ceramic failure and debonding"
Text Summarization,English,"You are an expert medical assistant named Aloe, developed by the High Performance Artificial Intelligence Group at Barcelona Supercomputing Center(BSC). You are to be a helpful, respectful, and honest assistant.","You will be given a background statement and some study titles and abstracts. Your task is to summarize the main conclusions of the studies. Background: background and purpose knowledge about robust and unbiased factors that predict outcome of activities of daily living ( adl ) is paramount in stroke management . This review investigates the method ological quality of prognostic studies in the early poststroke phase for final adl to identify variables that are predictive or not predictive for outcome of adl after stroke . Study1: prediction of long-term functional outcome in patients with acute ischemic non-embolic stroke. In a prospect i ve observational study , we assessed the relative value of conventional stroke risk factors and emerging markers in the prediction of functional outcome of patients surviving the acute phase of an ischemic non-embolic stroke . All available eligible patients consecutively admitted due to a first-ever acute ischemic non-embolic stroke during a 2-year period were evaluated . In a total of 105 patients ( 54 males , 51 diabetic ) a series of clinical , biochemical and imaging characteristics were recorded , including demographic data , blood pressure , serum glucose , insulin , lipids , inflammatory markers , intima-media thickness of the carotid arteries ( imt ) , brain damage location and size of the infa rct volume . Barthel activities of daily living index ( bi ) scale was used to assess the severity of neurological deficit on admission and the functional outcome 6 months after discharge . Brain infa rct volume , stroke location in the anterior circulation , age , diabetes mellitus , imt and plasma interleukin-1beta levels proved to be significant determinants of long-term functional outcome , assessed by bi disability score . Roc curve analyses indicated that the infa rct volume is superior to other predictors in the diagnosis of patients with unfavorable functional outcome ( bi<95 ) at 6 months post-discharge ( area under the curve , auc=0.80 , 95 % confidence interval 0.64 - 0.95 ; p=0.003 ) . Significant differences in the mean infa rct volume were noted among age tertiles , with the diabetic patients in the 3rd tertile of age experiencing the worst outcome ( lsd test , p=0.019 ) . Taken together , the assessment of infa rct volume seems to have a significant predictive value regarding long-term functional outcome , especially in the elderly diabetic patients study2: ischemic stroke: relation of age, lesion location, and initial neurologic deficit to functional outcome. Objective establish the relation between age , gender , initial neurologic deficit , stroke location , prior stroke , hemisphere of stroke , and functional outcome in ischemic stroke . Design single group , multivariate , repeated measures design with 327 persons having ischemic stroke recruited from 20 participating centers . Setting twenty european stroke centers . Patients consecutive admissions of men and women between the ages of 40 and 85 yrs with a hemispheric stroke caused by middle cerebral artery ischemia and a unified neurological stroke scale score of 5 to 24 . Interventions in patients enrolled in the trial received traditional rehabilitation therapies including physical therapy , occupational therapy , and speech therapy when appropriate . Main outcome measures barthel index computed at 7 to 10 days and 3 months poststroke . Results positive functional outcomes were significantly related to the absence of prior strokes , a younger age , a less severe initial neurologic deficit , stroke involving cortical structures , and dominant ( left hemisphere ) lesions . Conclusions despite some inconsistencies in existing literature , st and ardized prospect i ve examination of outcome after stroke clearly demonstrated the effect of age , initial severity of stroke , and lesion location as predictors of functional outcome study3: measurement of motor recovery after stroke: outcome assessment and sample size requirements background and purpose the purpose of this study was to analyze recovery of motor function in a cohort of patients presenting with an acute occlusion in the carotid distribution . Analysis of recovery patterns is important for estimating patient care needs , establishing therapeutic plans , and estimating sample sizes for clinical intervention trials . Methods we prospect ively measured the motor deficits of 104 stroke patients over a 6-month period to identify earliest measures that would predict subsequent motor recovery . Motor function was measured with the fugl-meyer assessment . Fifty-four patients were r and omly assigned to a training set for model development ; 50 patients were assigned to a test set for model validation . In a second analysis , patients were stratified on basis of time and stroke severity . The sample size required to detect a 50 % improvement in residual motor function was calculated for each level of impairment and at three points in time . Results at baseline the initial fugl-meyer motor scores accounted for only half the variance in 6-month motor function ( r2=0.53 , p<0.001 ) . After 5 days , both the 5-day motor and sensory scores explained 74 % of the variance ( p<0.001 ) . After 30 days , the 30-day motor score explained 86 % of the variance ( p<0.001 ) . Application of these best models to the test set confirmed the results obtained with the training set . Sample -size calculations revealed that as severity and time since stroke increased , sample sizes required to detect a 50 % improvement in residual motor deficits decreased . Conclusions most of the variability in motor recovery can be explained by 30 days after stroke . These findings have important implication s for clinical practice and research study4: variables explaining functional recovery following motor stroke abstract : few well‐ design ed descriptive studies focus exclusively on patients after motor stroke . This study describes a cohort of participants after motor stroke and assesses the extent to which five key variables explain the variation in functional recovery 3 months after stroke . Prospect i ve data were collected ( n = 100 ) on age , lesion volume , motor strength , cognition , and poststroke function during the acute care hospital admission . Instruments included magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) to provide a measure of lesion volume , the mini‐mental state examination ( mmse ) and the neurobehavioral cognitive status examination ( ncse ) to measure cognitive status , and the national institutes of health stroke scale ( nihss ) to measure motor strength . The functional independence measure ( fimtm ) was used to measure baseline function and functional recovery 3 months after stroke . Descriptive and hierarchical multiple regression analyses were used to describe the cohort and predict functional recovery . The means for key variables during acute care were 65 ( ±15 ) years of age , lesion volume 21.5 ( ±44.7 ) cm3 , nihss 6.34 ( ±3.55 ) , mmse 24.38 ( ±4.82 ) , ncse 64.33 ( ±13 ) , and fimtm 94.05 ( ±19.31 ) . Age , cognitive status , and initial function accounted for 42 % of the variance in functional recovery 3 months after stroke . Results indicate that neuroscience nurses need to add cognition to their focus during the fast‐paced acute phase of care following motor stroke study5: predicting functional outcome and survival after acute ischemic stroke abstract . Objective : disability and mortality represent the most relevant clinical outcome after acute ischemic stroke . However , vali date d and comprehensive prognostic models for recovery have not been developed . An accurate model including all previously suggested independent outcome predictors could improve the design and analysis of clinical trials . We therefore developed prognostic models for functional dependence and death after 100 days in a large cohort of stroke patients . Methods : from the german stroke data base , 1754 prospect ively collected records of patients with acute ischemic stroke were used for the development of prognostic models . Intubated patients and patients with low functional status before stroke were excluded . Functional independence was defined as a barthel index ≥95 after 100 days . Prognostic factors assessable within 72 hours after admission were identified by a systematic literature review . The final models of binary logistic regression analyses were internally vali date d and calibrated . Results : the result ing cross-vali date d and calibrated models correctly classified more than 80 % of the patients and yielded the following prognostic factors for functional independence : age , right and left arm paresis at admission , nih-stroke scale at admission , rankin scale 48–72 hours later , gender , prior stroke , diabetes , fever , lenticulostriate infa rct ion , neurological complications . The following variables were identified as prognostic factors for death : age , nih-stroke scale at admission , and fever . Conclusions : our work gives an important insight into prognostic factors after acute ischemic stroke and presents predictive models with high prognostic accuracy . Together with a prospect i ve validation study , currently underway , we hence hope to improve the prediction of functional outcome after ischemic stroke study6: baseline nih stroke scale score predicting outcome in anterior and posterior circulation strokes objective : the nih stroke scale ( nihss ) may not appropriately assess the spectrum of posterior circulation (pc)–related neurologic deficits . We determined the cutoff baseline nihss score that predicts independent daily life activity during the chronic stage in anterior circulation ( ac ) vs pc ischemic strokes . Methods : a total of 310 consecutive patients hospitalized within 3 days after the onset of an ischemic stroke were prospect ively enrolled in the study . Patients on thrombolytic therapy were excluded . In all patients , infa rcts and vascular lesions were identified primarily using magnetic resonance techniques . A favorable outcome was defined as a modified rankin scale score of ≤2 at 3 months poststroke . Results : in 101 patients with pc stroke , the total baseline nihss score was lower ( p < 0.001 ) , and the subscores of ataxia ( p < 0.001 ) and visual fields ( p = 0.043 ) were higher than in 209 patients with ac stroke . Multivariate-adjusted or for the favorable outcome in patients with pc vs ac stroke was 2.339 ( 95 % ci 1.331–4.109 , p = 0.003 ) . A low baseline nihss score was independently predictive of a favorable outcome in both patients with pc ( or 1.547 , 95 % ci 1.232–1.941 ) and ac ( 1.279 , 1.188–1.376 ) stroke . The optimal cutoff scores of the baseline nihss for the favorable outcome were ≤5 for patients with pc stroke ( sensitivity , 84 % ; specificity , 81 % ) and ≤8 for patients with ac stroke ( sensitivity , 80 % ; specificity , 82 % ) . Conclusions : the cutoff score of the baseline nih stroke scale ( nihss ) for a favorable chronic outcome was relatively low in patients with pc stroke compared to patients with ac stroke . The nihss appears to have limitations with respect to its use when comparing the neurologic severity of pc and ac stroke study7: prestroke physical function predicts stroke outcomes in the elderly. Objective to determine whether physical function before stroke is an independent predictor of physical function and institutionalization 6 months after discharge from hospital in elderly stroke patients . Design population -based prospect i ve cohort design where incidence of stroke was monitored from 1982 through 1988 . Baseline demographic and health information including prestroke function was collected prospect ively . Eligible subjects who had a stroke were interviewed 6 months after discharge from hospital to assess outcomes . Setting new haven , connecticut . Patients subjects were recruited from an initial sample of 2,812 older adults . Of 79 subjects who survived a first stroke at 6 months postdischarge , complete follow-up data were obtained on 63 subjects . Main outcome measure physical function as measured by the katz scale and institutionalization . Results fewer limitations in activities of daily living before stroke were associated with fewer limitation in physical function after stroke controlling for stroke severity and other relevant health and sociodemographic conditions ( p < .01 ) . Fewer limitations in gross mobility function before stroke were also independently associated with a lower risk of institutionalization ( p < .05 ) . Conclusion this study provides useful information in assessing the prognosis of elderly stroke patients upon admission to hospital . It also supports the concept of general frailty being a risk factor for poorer health and institutionalization overall in aged persons . Studies have shown that factors related to physical frailty , such as decline in muscle function , can be reversed . The effect of interventions aim ed at improving the physical function of the elderly on stroke incidence , stroke outcomes , and all-cause mortality , however , needs to be determined study8: a predictive risk model for outcomes of ischemic stroke. Background and purpose the great variability of outcome seen in stroke patients has led to an interest in identifying predictors of outcome . The combination of clinical and imaging variables as predictors of stroke outcome in a multivariable risk adjustment model may be more powerful than either alone . The purpose of this study was to determine the multivariable relationship between infa rct volume , 6 clinical variables , and 3-month outcomes in ischemic stroke patients . Methods included in the study were 256 eligible patients from the r and omized trial of tirilazad mesylate in acute stroke ( ranttas ) . Six clinical variables and 1-week infa rct volume were the prespecified predictor variables . The national institutes of health stroke scale , barthel index , and glasgow outcome scale were the outcomes . Multivariable logistic regression techniques were used to develop the model equations , and bootstrap techniques were used for internal validation . Predictive performance of the models was assessed for discrimination with receiver operator characteristic ( roc ) curves and for calibration with calibration curves . Results the predictive models had areas under the roc curve of 0.79 to 0.88 and demonstrated nearly ideal calibration curves . The areas under the roc curves were statistically greater ( p<0.001 ) with both clinical and imaging information combined than with either alone for predicting excellent recovery and death or severe disability . Conclusions combined clinical and imaging variables are predictive of 3-month outcome in ischemic stroke patients . Demonstration of this relationship with acute clinical variables and 1-week infa rct information supports future attempts to predict 3-month outcome with all acute variables study9: death and functional outcome after spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage. A prospective study of 166 cases using multivariate analysis. Using death and functional status as end points , we prospect ively analyzed the outcome 6 months after spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage in 166 patients admitted to an acute-care stroke unit on the first day of their stroke . Seventy-one patients ( 43 % ) died , 69 ( 42 % ) had a satisfactory outcome , and 26 ( 16 % ) had a poor functional outcome . Early ( 30-day ) survival was correlated with morphologic parameters on the initial computed tomogram ( hemorrhage size , midline shift , and intraventricular spread of the hemorrhage ) , while later ( 6-month ) survival was correlated with age . Using logistic regression , we found five independent predictors of satisfactory outcome at 6 months : age , hemorrhage size , intraventricular spread of the hemorrhage , limb paresis , and communication disorders . Of these , age was the most important predictor by far study10: predicting outcome in hyper-acute stroke: validation of a prognostic model in the third international stroke trial (ist3) background and purpose : models are used to adjust for case mix and to stratify treatment allocation in clinical trials and can , if accurate enough , be used to aid decision-making in individual patients . We aim ed to vali date , in patients assessed within 6 hours of onset , a previously described six simple variable ( ssv ) model that was developed in stroke patients who were assessed sub-acutely . The explanatory variables in the model are age , living alone , independent pre-stroke , glasgow coma scale verbal score , ability to lift arms and ability to walk . Methods : the six variables were collected at r and omisation in the third international stroke trial ( ist3 ) trial of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator in ischaemic stroke . We assessed survival to 30 days and functional status at 6 months using the oxford h and icap scale . We constructed receiver operator characteristic ( roc ) curves to establish the model 's discriminatory performance and tested its calibration by charting predicted versus actual outcomes . Results : 537 patients ( mean age , 74 years ) were included , of whom 422 ( 79 % ) survived 30 days and 179 ( 33 % ) were alive and independent at 6 months . The ssv model had an area under the roc curve of 0.73 for 30-day survival and 0.82 for independent survival at 6 months . Calibration was satisfactory . Conclusions : this study confirms the external validity of the ssv model in an ischaemic stroke population assessed within 6 hours of symptom onset . The ssv model comprising easily collected variables can therefore be used to stratify patients in hyper-acute stroke trials , but probably is not accurate enough for decision-making in individual patients","Conclusions: because of insufficient method ological quality of most prognostic studies , the predictive value of many clinical determinants for outcome of adl remains unclear ."
